The  project has been financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP) acts as the GEF Implementing Agency. The project is  being executed by Industrial Modernization Centre (IMC) of the Ministry of Industry and  Foreign Trade, which will assume the overall responsibility for the achievement of project  results as UNDP\u2019s Implementing Partner  \n Scope and purpose  \n The scope of this document is to provide a guideline for tendering grid connected small- scale PV systems. These guidelines have been prepared for the benefits of miscellaneous  departments and sectors buildings in Egypt. The document is considered as a guiding  document, so it is generic and can be tailored as per end user needs, but still it includes the  minimum acceptance requirements for optimum performance grid connected PV systems.  However, the tenderer shall assume full responsibility for proper and adequate performance  of this proposed system, and accordingly, he may propose additional technical merits he  believes would be useful to improve system performance where acceptance such additional  proposal shall be at the sole discretion of the owner.       \n Legal framework within the Egyptian context  \n There are many applications for solar PV, either on-grid or off-grid. This document focuses  on the on-grid PV plants. The on-grid PV plants injects energy units (kWh) to the grid,  these energy units\u2019 consumption and production are differentiated and the consumer pays  the net metered value.  Net Metering: Net Consumption (kWh) \u2013 Net Produced from PV system (kWh) = Value of  electricity to be paid by consumer, for more information, data are available here:  http://egyptera.org/Downloads/journal/2017/periodical_book5.PDF   \n   \n  26  \n Rooftop installation requirements  \n The PV panels require a shadow free area, the required shadow free area for installing  systems varies depending on the site condition. This area includes provision for clearances  between solar PV array rows. The solar panels may be installed on the roof of the building  with a south facing tilt angle that varies from 20o till 33o.   \n The variation in the tilt angle doesn\u2019t affect much the system yield like the panel orientation  do, so it\u2019s much advisable that panels face SOUTH direction. Some cases require different  tilt angles and orientations depending on the site conditions, those cases will be studied to  ensure the best performance ratio and system productivity. The installed PV plants shall be  cleaned sufficiently, regarding its erection area, i.e. installing PV plant in desert area will  require more cleaning rather than in urban areas. On the other hand, its life time should be  considered also, i.e. 1-year lifetime will require a piece of cloth and clean, 3 years will have  required rinsing panels with water, while 7 years\u2019 lifetime may require chemical materials  to clean the panels.  The PV solar inverter is from grid-connected type, as any electronic device it requires to be  installed in a place away from dust, air, and rain. Moreover, it should be placed in an  accessible and safely placed, unless the inverter has high IP and doesn\u2019t need to be placed  indoors.  \n    27  1  INTRODUCTION  In the framework of the cooperation protocol which was signed between the IMC  and the Parliament for implementing a number of projects within the context of  Grid-Connected Small-Scale Photovoltaic Systems \u201cEgypt \u2013 PV\u201d The Parliament  hereinafter referred to as the \"Owner\" intends to acquire Photovoltaic (PV) grid- connected system for Parliament building at Cairo city, as follows:  \uf0a7 100 KWp PV power system to supply the building internal lighting, connected to  the building internal electrical Network through Grid Tie Inverter.     \n Tenderers are invited to submit their offers for the Supply, Installation and startup  the PV system in accordance with the technical specifications of the required PV  system.   \n 2 SITE AND LOCATION OF THE REQUIRED PV SYSTEM  The Parliament buildings is located in Cairo along Al-Falaki Street.  A Guideline layout of the parliament facility building is shown in appendix (4) where  the proposed locations for installing the PV system is as follow:  3 Technical Specifications  3.1  General technical Requirements:       The general design requirements shall consider the following:  3.1.1 The PV power system will be designed to yield the  maximum possible amount of energy on yearly average  basis.  3.1.2 The PV support structure should be designed to a fixed tilt  angle equal to the latitude angle of the site. However  slightly different tilt angles may be proposed but should  \n  28  \n  be clearly justified and would be accepted at the discretion  of the owner.    \n 3.1.3 The overall system design and its components shall be  commercially available and shall conform to acceptable  commercial and international industry practice.  3.1.4 The installed system should be complaint with the Egyptian  Distribution Grid Code and with the technical requirements,  the regulations & safety procedures for connecting the PV  systems to the electrical grid as per the regulations available  on \"Egyptera\" website: www.egyptera.org\\renewables  3.1.5 Tenderers are requested to provide their estimates of the  system output energy in (kWh/year) and the expected  produced  electric  energy  by  the  system  against  corresponding different solar radiation values year-round.  All assumption should be stated in a way that allows  calculations to be repeated and verified. If specialized &  certified    software is used, such software should be named  and outputs provided such as (PVSYST or PVSOL, etc).  Potential shadowing effect, if any, should be taken into  consideration and clearly indicated in estimating the yearly  energy yield of the proposed PV system configuration.  Special attention shall be given to how the estimated PV  energy yearly output was developed where the owner  reserves the right for requesting clarification and adequate  confirmation to that effect. In view of above, tenderers are  encouraged and recommended to pay a site visit to the  location prior to preparing the offers.      \n  29      \n 3.1.6  (1) Ambient temperatures ranging from -5\u2103 to 65\u2103  degree Celsius and (2) relative humidity of up to 95%.  \n 3.1.7 Personnel safety during installations, operational and  maintenance of the system after the start of operation shall  be an integral part of the system design.

STRATEGIC CONTEXT  \n A. Country Context  1.  Mozambique is a low-income country in Southeast Africa with a gross domestic product (GDP) of  US$417 per capita and a population of 29.6 million. It is in the south-eastern corner of southern Africa, with four  of the six neighboring countries landlocked and is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east. The country is  endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, as well as mineral resources and newly discovered natural gas  offshore; three deep seaports; and a relatively large potential pool of labor. The economy is still strongly  influenced by agricultural sector that accounts for 22 percent of Mozambique\u2019s GDP but employs about 71 percent  of the population.1 Close to 94 percent of the poor are engaged in agriculture and most of them are rural  residents.2 The extractive sector has been a driver of the recent improvement in GDP growth, maintaining double- digit output growth in 2016 and early 2017, with a 41 percent expansion in output mostly driven by mineral  exports.  2.  Mozambique has experienced a prolonged period of sustained growth; however, its macroeconomic  stability has been compromised by an untenable debt situation, resulting in a tight fiscal context. After  registering 7 percent GDP growth on average since 2011, Mozambique\u2019s economic performance experienced a  sharp downturn, triggered by falling commodity prices, adverse climate conditions, and the discovery of US$1.4  billion in previously undisclosed public debt (equal to about 10 percent of GDP). The Government of Mozambique  (GoM) responded to the economic slowdown and debt accumulation with a revised budget, restructured spending  program, and overtures to creditors to begin restructuring talks. The authorities have started tackling difficult  reforms such as fuel subsidies and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform and are also developing a new state- owned enterprise law to strengthen the SOE\u2019s management. This is accompanied by a tight fiscal context, and  with both credit and investment levels continuing at a low level. Therefore, improving the efficiency and impact  of existing social and government spending has become even more of an imperative.  3.  The pace of poverty reduction in Mozambique is accelerating but with significant spatial variation.  Poverty has been on a declining trend (poverty headcount fell from 60.3 percent in 2002/2003 to 48.4 percent in  2014/2015) accompanied by progress on related development indicators such as health and education. However,  growth became less inclusive in recent years, with many low-income households missing out on the benefits of  such growth. Poverty would have fallen by twice as much since 2002 had growth been more equally shared.3  Education levels are slowly increasing in Mozambique, although from low levels of school attainment and quality  of education overall, with a large gap between rural and urban areas, preventing a more inclusive development  of human capital. As per the Human Capital Index, Mozambique reached 0.361 points in 2017, lower than the  average for its region and income group and it ranks 148 out of 157 countries. In addition, the distribution of  poverty is uneven across the country, with rural provinces in the center and the north accounting for a  disproportionate share of the poor (about 70 percent). The three poorest provinces - Zambezia, Niassa and  Nampula \u2013 are all located in north and central Mozambique provinces. Mozambique\u2019s ability to boost growth and  reduce poverty depends on the working age population having access to productive jobs in the formal and  informal sector (including smallholder agriculture and non-farm \u201chousehold enterprises\u201d which are typically  located in peri-urban areas).                                               1 World Bank. (2018). Mozambique Economic Update. October.  2 World Bank. (2018). Strong but not Broadly Shared Growth \u2013 Mozambique Poverty Report.  3 Idem.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 7 of 84         \n 4.  Mozambique\u2019s rapidly growing population, together with its high youth dependency ratio, is and will  continue to pose increasing pressure on public service delivery and infrastructure. Urban growth continues to  rapidly unfold in Mozambique with increasing concentration of people and economic activity in urban areas. Yet,  despite rapid growth in urban employment, the urbanization process in Mozambique continues to be gradual  relative to the pace of urbanization in other African countries. Natural population growth accounts for much of  the current increase in the urban population.4 The country\u2019s fertility rate is estimated at 5.9 children per woman,  and children aged 0 -14 represented more than 45 percent of the population in 2015. A large majority of girls  marry before age 18 and start childbearing at a very early age.5 Rapid population growth will continue to put  pressure on existing infrastructure, requiring higher rates of investment to enhance capacity and efficiency of  service delivery to sustain growth in the medium term.  5.  Mozambique\u2019s five-year Government Plan (2015\u20132019) highlights agricultural and industrial  development as the basis for socioeconomic development of the country. The five-year Government Plan  presents five strategic pillars to achieve accelerated economic growth and social development. It also targets  expanded infrastructure as a key element to enhance the productive sectors of the economy, economic  diversification, and improve access to markets. This calls for expanding access to electricity services to all  Mozambicans by 2030 to support the young and growing population with productive opportunities.  B. Sectoral and Institutional Context  6.  The current institutional structure of the power sector derives from the 1997 Electricity Law. The  Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (Ministerio de Recursos Minerais e Energia, MIREME) is the government  entity responsible for energy policy and planning, as well as monitoring sector performance and governance.  Electricity of Mozambique (Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique, EDM) is the state-owned, vertically integrated utility  with operations in generation, transmission, and distribution countrywide. Cahora Bassa Hydropower  (Hidroel\u00e9ctrica de Cahora Bassa, HCB) is the largest power generation company, in charge of operating the 2,075  MW Cahora Bassa power plant and the associated transmission system; the generation sector is complemented  by independent power producers (IPP) that have signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with EDM. In May  2017, the Parliament approved the creation of Energy Regulatory Authority (Autoridade Reguladora de Energia,  ARENE) in an effort to separate regulatory and policy functions in MIREME. The new regulatory body has been  given the authority \u2013 inter alia \u2013 to regulate the electricity tariff, promote and monitor competition in the power  sector, and monitor and enforce the terms and conditions of the licenses or concession contracts in the power  sector. The Energy Fund (Fundo de Energia, FUNAE) is a public body subordinated to MIREME with the aim of  promoting the development and use of different forms of low-cost energy and the sustainable management of  energy resources. Initially setup as a fund, FUNAE today mostly implements off-grid access projects. In addition  to the Electricity Law, private investments in the electricity sector are also governed by the Public-private  Partnership (PPP) Law (2011).   Sector Achievements are Manifold Across the Value-chain  7.  The Mozambican power sector has been developed with a two-fold objective to meet domestic electricity  demand through EDM and to develop the export market as an anchor demand to exploit the large indigenous  energy resources. Both these strategic objectives have competing needs due to the large investment  requirements.                                               4 World Bank. (2017). Mozambique Urbanization Review (Report AUS15538).  5 As of 2011, about 40 percent of adolescents were mothers or pregnant, and this percentage has barely changed in the last fifteen years.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 8 of 84         \n 8.  Mozambique is rich in conventional and renewable energy sources and has emerged as a regional  energy hub. Mozambique has 7.5 GW of renewable energy potential, including 5.6 GW of hydro, 1.1 GW of wind  and 0.6 GW of solar.6 The country has also significant experience with gas through the Pande/Temane fields.  Furthermore, gas reserves in the Rovuma Basin, offshore in Northern Mozambique, are sufficiently large to be  used simultaneously for exports, major industry and power generation. Mozambique also has world class reserves  of coal. Part of these reserves have sufficient quality to be exported, while a significant portion can be used for  domestic power generation. Mozambique\u2019s vast energy resources are far in excess to satisfy domestic demand  (historically growing at 10 percent annually), including access expansion; the country is also well positioned to  engage in significant regional trade. The country is well interconnected with South Africa, the country\u2019s largest  purchaser of electricity - mostly from Cahora Bassa Hydropower plant (1,330 MW of HCB\u2019s total capacity is  committed to the South African electricity utility (ESKOM), under a long-term PPA, that ends in 2029) \u2013 and with  other neighboring countries, with opportunities for onward trade with the wider region forming the Southern  African Power Pool. Currently, Mozambique\u2019s installed capacity largely constitutes of hydro (56 percent) and  thermal (42 percent) \u2013 signaling a substantial contribution of base-load renewable energy.  9.  Private sector has played an important role in Mozambique\u2019s generation capacity expansion since 2014.  EDM has mobilized private and public financing for several generation projects7 in the form of state-owned power  plants or PPP. The commissioning of these power generation projects has enabled Mozambique not only to meet  its domestic demand, removing emergency generation supply, but also to position the country as an important  player in the regional electricity market, with the possibility \u2013 and risk \u2013 to boost EDM\u2019s revenues in hard currency  through electricity exports. Out of the 415 MW of new generation commissioned since 2014, 315 MW (76 percent)  have been developed through independent power producers IPPs models with PPAs signed with EDM.   10.  Access to grid electricity has expanded more than three times in past 10 years through grid extension  and off-grid energy market is starting to emerge. EDM has increased access to electricity services from 8 percent  in 2006 to 31 percent in 2018; reaching through the grid all administrative centers across the country while also  serving some isolated areas, in the absence of a nationally interconnected grid system.8 Currently, EDM serves  more than 1.89 million customers, including around 1.76 million with prepaid meters. In the off-grid space, in the  past two years, emerging new players have started providing high-quality certified solar products with more  flexible payment schemes such as pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) model. The PAYGO providers in Mozambique are  currently serving about 15,500 customers. Among the 20 countries in the world with largest access deficit,  Mozambique increased electricity access at a rate faster than the global average (Figure 1).                                                6 Renewable Energy Atlas of Mozambique, 1st Edition 2014.  7 Operational: Ressano Garcia Thermal Power Plant (Central Termica Ressano Garcia, CTRG) (175 MW, gas), Gigawatt (100 MW, gas),  Kuvaninga (40 MW, gas), Central Termica Maputo (CTM) (100 MW, gas), Mucuba (40 MW, solar).   8 Mozambique has a total of 128 administrative centers.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 9 of 84         \n Figure 1. The 20 Countries with the Largest Access-deficit over the 2010 - 2016 Period  \n Source: World Bank, Tracking SDG79.   11.  The affordability of consumers has been an important attribute of tariff design. EDM\u2019s social tariff (Mt  1.07/kWh = US$c1.7/kWh) is adequate to ensure the affordability of subsistence level (about 30 kWh) of electricity  service \u2013 at about 1.3 percent of a low-income household\u2019s expenditure. This is true for all provinces of  Mozambique, even in poor provinces, households can afford subsistence volumes of electricity (Annex 3). Under  the GoM\u2019s universal tariff policy, this tariff would apply for both grid connection and mini-grid connection,  ensuring that the electricity service is affordable to the poor segments of Mozambican population.   12.  There is a sizable yet nascent market for standalone off-grid solutions dominated by private solar  companies. These solutions are widely recognized in Mozambican households as alternative sources of energy  that can replace candles, batteries and kerosene. However, due to the low purchasing power of households, the  market has been dominated by low-quality products which are traded in informal (untaxed) markets. This has  negatively affected the consumer confidence in solar solutions. High quality solar products are available in  Mozambique, but prices are not affordable for most of the population. Some enterprises offering high quality  products have adopted the PAYGO option to reduce upfront payment requirement and, thus, enhance  affordability; yet, these enterprises remain small, targeting consumers located in urban and peri-urban areas of  large cities. Development partners, such as Sweden and the United Kingdom, have launched programs aimed to  provide financial support through matching grants and credit lines for working capital for such off-grid solutions  providers.  Substantial Challenges Remain in the Power Sector  13.  First, the Mozambican electricity transmission system remains weak and is separated in three sub- systems. The northern and the central systems are connected, albeit with a relatively weak link, there is no  internal connection with the southern system, where most of demand is. Electricity from Cahora Bassa,  Mozambique\u2019s main power plant, located in the northern system, is routed to the southern system through the  South Africa\u2019s grid. Mozambique transmission network lacks resilience and is not sufficiently spread out to allow  development of the lower voltage networks in all areas where access expansion is needed. Lack of national                                               9 https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/data/files/download-documents/chapter_2_electrification.pdf.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 10 of 84         \n interconnectivity prevents the installed capacity to be efficiently dispatched and to meet the growing demand for  electricity in the north.  14.  Second, EDM is experiencing a fragile financial  situation. This is due to a combination of: (a) a  deteriorating macroeconomic situation; (b) retail tariffs  not recovering the cost of power purchases and  operations; (c) capital expenditures (CAPEX) for  rehabilitation of the network and increasing energy  access not being adequately funded; (d) adverse  conditions in the regional power market (decrease in  export prices); (e) limited supply from HCB due to  hydrological constraints; and (f) high electricity losses  estimated at 29.8 percent (in 2018). Despite several  tariff adjustments, the last one introduced in December  2018, EDM has been accumulating operational losses  on an accrual basis as well as significant payable arrears  on cash basis. EDM\u2019s financial position also worsened  due to the accumulation of receivables arrears,  particularly from electricity exports to Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO).10 Despite a partial debt  restructuring process and a more regular electricity supply from HCB in 2018, EDM remains exposed to several  exogenous factors and its financial position remains tight.  15.  Third, about two-thirds of Mozambicans do not have access to electricity, which is below the average  for Sub-Saharan Africa.11 Provision of electricity services demonstrates disparities between urban and rural areas  (54 percent of urban population have access compared with only 6 percent of rural population with electricity  service). In rural areas, while FUNAE has been able to reach 260 villages (and 580 schools and 561 health centers),  an overwhelming majority of rural population use alternative modes of lighting such as kerosene and candles to  cope without electricity. The cost of electrification programs is not covered by electricity tariffs nor is EDM  receiving subsidies from the Government for this purpose. So far, EDM and FUNAE has been implementing the  electrification investments with limited available resources based on unclear priorities set at the political level and  without proper planning following low-cost prioritization. Additionally, the sustainability of the service provided  by FUNAE, that operates on a fee-for-service model, remains a challenge due to an unproven business model.                                               10 Throughout the year 2016, ZESCO, accumulated arrears to EDM to the value of US$60 million. Repayment of these arrears is still under  negotiation between the two utilities.  11 The average rate of access to electricity service for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is 38 percent.   Figure 2.

Note: National Electrification Strategy (NES) represents a renewed momentum and paradigm shift towards  Mozambique\u2019s quest to achieve universal access by 2030 \u2013 70 percent from grid and 30 percent from off-grid.  16.  The GoM has recently launched the \u201cPrograma Nacional de Energia para Todos\u201d [Electricity for All  National Program], representing a key milestone in reaching all Mozambicans with electricity access by 2030.  The Government, with the World Bank and other development partners\u2019 (DP) support, sponsored consultations  and workshops since October 2016 to discuss the principles of an NES that would allow Mozambique to achieve  universal access by 2030. The NES Roadmap proposes that during the initial stage EDM should take the lead in  identifying and implementing on-grid projects following project prioritization criteria and electrification schemes,  while FUNAE focuses on the implementation of off-grid solutions. FUNAE will then hand-over the operation and  maintenance (O&M) of mini-grids to EDM for commercial and operational activities. NES constitutes the following  key elements:   a.  The GoM, through MIREME, determines the priority sites to be electrified \u2013 both on and off-grid and  provides the financial means through government contribution from budget, taxes from generation  concessioners and exports, concessional financing from DPs and contribution from existing users  through an electrification levy;   b.  EDM and FUNAE implement the electrification process with optimized technical standards and new  procedures;   c.  ARENE approves electricity tariffs that allows recouping the efficient cost of service provision; and  d.  Electrification is pursued on a systematic manner following least cost principles that contemplates the  development objectives of the GoM and optimization of technical design of the grid.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 12 of 84         \n Figure 4.

Electricity connections will need to ramp up from  165,000 a year in 2018 to 350,000 in 2020 and to 590,000 on average between 2025 and 2030 to achieve universal  access by 2030, with an estimated investment of US$6.5 billion. It is expected that 70 percent of the population  will be connected to the grid while 30 percent will be provided with off-grid energy solutions. Quintupling the  number of consumers from about 1,550,000 in 2017 to about 7,800,000 by 2030 challenges not only distribution  and commercial practices but also transmission and  generation.  It  will  require  a  complete  internal  restructuring of EDM\u2019s management, operations, logistics,  technical staff, and systems to be able to incorporate  around three times more the number of new clients and  provide quality services to existing and new consumers.   18.  The NES advocates a complementary approach  encompassing  both  grid  and  off-grid  solutions.  Considering the ambitions and challenges in achieving  universal access in Mozambique, adoption of multiple  modalities for electrification is required, including  densification of already electrified areas to reach all  existing households, businesses and public facilities,  expansion of the national grid to all areas where this is  Figure 5.

This will create the critical mass to contribute financially to reach remote and unserved  areas of the country, where high development costs are combined with low affordability of the population. In  parallel, off-grid electricity services through mini-grids and standalone solar home systems (SHS) can be provided  as an intermediary solution. A preliminary analysis from the Mozambique Geospatial Options Analysis towards  Universal Electrification (funded by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program [ESMAP]) shows that  around 14 percent of the population (4 million) are in the proximity of the national grid and could potentially be  connected through grid-densification. Additionally, areas that are not currently served by EDM could be served  either by extending the grid requiring investments in transmission and distribution, mini-grids or by SHSs. The  number of potential beneficiaries varies depending on the priorities for expansion of the national network and  the migration to urban settlements in the following 12 years.   Figure 6.

EDM is implementing multifaceted measures to improve its operational and financial performance. The  Integrated Management System, (Sistema Integrado de Gest\u00e3o, SIGEM), financed by the World Bank through the  Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP)(P108444) consisted of the incorporation by EDM of a set of  management information systems (MIS) and other tools to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability  in operations in all business areas, as well as enhance corporate governance within the company and to external  stakeholders. As a result, in 2018 EDM has been able, for the first time, to publish its financial statements of 2017  externally audited without any qualification. The ongoing Power Efficiency and Reliability Improvement Project  (PERIP) (P158249) ensures effective application of functionalities of the incorporated MIS in processes and  activities carried out in all business areas. Activities to be strengthened comprise, among others: (a) reinforcement  of the company\u2019s financial management (FM) system, including the publication of audited financial statements;  (b) optimization of revenue cycle for postpaid customers, management of prepayment customers and customer  service; (c) revenue protection of sales to large customers, including implementation of a second phase targeting  10,000 users; and (d) modernization of the data network infrastructure, to ensure optimality and high availability  of the commercial and financial data systems. Successful consolidation of these processes will create conditions  to manage large electrification programs.  20.  Private solar companies are interested in expanding business. The solar companies are already operating  in Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and Manica12 and a strong interest has been indicated to operate in Nampula and  Zambezia owing to their population size and density. However, the off-grid industry has to overcome two main  challenges: First, on the supply side, the majority of solar product distributors are informal without business  registration and tax payment to the Government. Few solar products are certified by international standards such  as Lighting Africa, and therefore the quality of products in the market vary significantly. Furthermore, the  distribution network for solar products and accessories is limited and mostly present in urban areas, with  insufficient outreach to remote areas where these solar solutions are more useful. Second, on the demand side,  considering the low saving rates of low-income population, there are affordability concerns even for pico-solar  products. Optimizing existing grid-based capital assets, piloting a new business model for mini-grids, and piloting  a financing facility for SHSs and their sustainability anchors, are fundamental aspects for creating space for both  public utility and private sector to partner in electricity access expansion.  21.  Creating a platform for private-sector participation in energy service delivery will accelerate delivery of  energy solutions to the population. A key feature of the NES to scale up the deployment of off-grid solutions is  to attract private sector participation to the off-grid market, particularly as partners in the generation component  of mini-grids and as retailers of standalone SHSs. The project will pilot the creation of a results-based financing  facility to support the expansion of the off-grid energy market in provinces where the poverty incidence is high.   22.  Balancing sector financial sustainability with consumer affordability is a precondition for the successful  implementation of Mozambique\u2019s \u201cPrograma Nacional de Energia para Todos\u201d. To ensure that access expansion  does not impose further financial burden on EDM, financing for the program will be repaid by the government  and will not be reflected on EDM\u2019s balance sheet13. Most importantly, the program directly addresses the                                               12 In Gaza, Inhambane and Manica, 35-45 percent of the population live below the poverty line according to World Bank estimate. In  Nampula and Zambezia, 60-65 percent of people are estimated to live under the poverty line.   13 The project will ensure complementarity with EDM\u2019s on-going modernization and operational recovery program under the ongoing PERIP  focusing on the rehabilitation and upgrade of the network infrastructure, the enhancement of EDM commercial and operational efficiency  and the provision of technical and capacity building. The project also aligns with sector financial recovery endeavors, which build on the  results of the Cost of Service Study (financed by the World Bank under SE4ALL technical assistance) that provided a new tariff methodology  to estimate the efficient cost of electricity service provision as well as the analytical foundations for the development of a comprehensive  Financial Strengthening Plan (FSP), currently under preparation with support from the World Bank, through ESMAP (please refer to Annex  4 for details).  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 15 of 84         \n affordability barriers of consumers. At present, the minimum upfront connection charge paid by new electricity  users in Mozambique is MZN 3,500 (approximately US$60) and represents approximately 1.5 times the monthly  household expenditure for the lowest income quintile and 13 percent for the highest income quintile. The project  will finance all electrification works EDM will recover operating expenditure (OPEX) to serve all its customers  through Allowed Tariff Revenues set by the competent authority.  23.  This project is part of a coordinated effort by the donor community to implement the NES. The project  establishes a coordinated collaboration between DPs and private sector through the design of financial incentives  to reduce cost, create a demonstration effect of off-grid solutions and develop a market for these products.  Recognizing the need to harmonize and simplify procedures independently of the sources of financing, the  Government of Norway and the World Bank have established a Mozambique Energy for All Multi-Donor Trust  Fund (MDTF) administrated by the World Bank for investments for on-grid connections. The Government of  Sweden and European Commission (EC) have also expressed interest to participate in this MDTF and are currently  in the process of securing approval. This MDTF will facilitate the implementation of the program and will ensure  that resources fully support the principles of the NES established by the GoM, particularly for on-grid with the  highest potential to reach a larger number of new households in a sustainable manner. In the off-grid space, the  United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID), the Governments of Sweden and Norway14  and the World Bank are supporting the implementation of the NES through different initiatives and projects with  the agreement to maximize collaboration (further details on donor\u2019s support for off-grid activities are presented  in Annex 4).

The project showcases a comprehensive approach to support the energy sector value chain in  Mozambique. The World Bank\u2019s energy portfolio in Mozambique, including recently closed and ongoing  operations, spans all energy sub-sectors, from generation, to transmission and distribution, to regional power  trade. The project is well aligned with this vast and diversified portfolio and complements well some of the  ongoing operations, notably the PERIP approved in 2017 and regional projects under preparation.  C. Relevance to Higher Level Objectives  25.  The project is fully aligned with the World Bank Group (WBG) ongoing Country Partnership Framework  (CPF) for Mozambique FY17\u2013FY2118. The proposed operation will directly support, under Focus Area 1  (\u201cPromoting Diversified Growth and Enhanced Productivity\u201d), the strategic objective of Expanding Access and  Improved Reliability of Electricity by helping increase the delivery of electricity services through grid extension  and provision of off-grid solutions throughout the country. In addition, the proposed project will support, under  Focus Area 2 (\u201cInvesting in Human Capital\u201d), the strategic objective of Enhancing the Skills Base and Improving  Health Service Delivery by providing electricity service access to public institutions within the project target areas.  Furthermore, the project will contribute to the CPF\u2019s cross-cutting issues, such as gender and climate change, by  supporting equal access to low-emission, renewable energy mini-grids and SHSs, reducing women\u2019s exposure to  indoor air pollution and providing them with access to better health services, particularly for maternal services.   26.  The project would also help meet the WBG twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and it  is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), and World Bank\u2019s  Energy Sector Directions Paper19. Providing electricity connections will increase access to electricity services for  poor households in rural and urban areas enabling opportunities to study and work, contributing to raising the  quality of life and improving safety at night and stimulating off-farm activity and economic interaction. Increased  access to reliable electricity supply will not only lower costs and improve the profitability of business enterprises  but is also key to enabling the set-up of new private sector-led enterprises, which stimulates GDP growth. The  project is also aligned with the Gender Equality and Development report20 and with the WBG Gender Strategy  \u201cGender Equality, Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth\u201d (FY16 -FY23).  27.  The World Bank\u2019s portfolio is well aligned with the principles of \u2018Maximizing Finance for Development\u2019.  The project is part of a larger comprehensive World Bank engagement in the energy sector providing support  across the value chain. The WBG is leveraging synergies between the World Bank and IFC which aims to have a  transformational impact in strengthening Mozambique\u2019s energy supply. Under the JIP, IDA financing focuses  primarily on improving electricity services through grid rehabilitation and reinforcement as well as strengthening                                               18 Report number: 104733.

The project provides public sector financing for grid electrification  where commercial financing is not considered viable, while also supporting increased private sector participation  in O&M and off-grid service delivery. Risk mitigation and financing by the WBG has been instrumental in attracting  some of the major IPPs and mobilizing private investment in the power sector.   II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  A. Project Development Objective  PDO Statement  28.  The Project Development Objective is to increase access to electricity service in Mozambique.  PDO Level Indicators  29.  The PDO Level indicator is: People provided with new or improved electricity services (number).  B. Project Components  30.  The proposed project contributes to the implementation of the \u201cPrograma Nacional de Energia para  Todos\u201d and will support the expansion of electricity access to peri-urban and rural areas by extending and  densifying the existing grid network and by promoting the use of off-grid energy solutions in those areas where  the grid extension is considered economically unfeasible. The national program is also financed by the GoM, DPs  and other sources indicated as per the NES. Disbursement forecasts are indicative, and they will be accelerated in  accordance with implementation progress, as required.  31.  The underlying premise is to harness economies of scale in existing grid infrastructure. While the network  reaches all 154 districts in the country with the existing distribution networks, a significant number of structures  (households, businesses, etc.) are still not connected. This creates an opportunity to use available capacity of  existing infrastructure to build additional distribution networks and service connections to incorporate and supply  new users. In the settlements to be electrified, the project will \u201csweep\u201d the areas by connecting all new potential  customers as the distribution lines are extended. This approach will maximize the economies of scale in the  connection process, minimize connection time and prevent discrimination against female headed households  (FHH), fostering gender equality.   32.  The project is complemented by three key technical assistance initiatives. First, a geospatial planning tool  will determine how to optimally expand the electrical grid, while identifying economically-viable mini-grid sites,  and suggesting priority focus areas for standalone solar solutions. Second, an off-grid market assessment will  provide information on the status, players and barriers for off-grid solutions. Third, a low-cost grid design review  will define the standards to maximize the use of resources and, thus, maximize access. This technique promotes  the use of single-wire earth return (SWER) and shield wire schemes when the load and the geographic conditions  are adequate. They are expected to significantly reduce the cost of connecting households compared to the  traditional three-phase lines currently used in Mozambique for grid-based electricity access expansion. These  activities are currently ongoing financed by the World Bank through ESMAP and PERIP.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 18 of 84         \n Component A: Peri-urban and Rural Electrification \u2013 (estimated cost US$126 million equivalent: IDA Grant -  US$60 million, Multi-Donor Trust Fund \u2013 US$66 million)  33.  This component will finance the design, procurement of materials and construction works required to  electrify all participating households and businesses in the project target areas with high population density,  located close to existing electricity networks (in peri-urban and rural areas). EDM and GoM have identified over  500 settlements to be electrified in approximately 20 districts across the country. The site identification has been  made based on the technical requirements and load profiles. The final selection of the sites will be confirmed by  the geospatial electrification tool (currently under development) based on a least cost approach. About 74 percent  of those settlements are in rural areas. The component is expected to connect around 250,000 households, of  which 185,000 are in rural areas and 65,000 in peri-urban areas. It is expected that nearly 50 percent of new  connections are made in the five poorest provinces of Mozambique \u2013 Niassa, Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado  and Sofala. In particular, more than 85,000 connections are expected to be made in Nampula.   34.  The component introduces new implementation arrangements (for example, clear responsibilities for  each implementing agency and enhanced supervision arrangements) and new procurement arrangements (for  example, procurement of main equipment in bulk and independent contracts for design, construction and  installation) to maximize the resources available and efficiently implement the project with the expectation of  reducing connection costs and, thus, maximize the number of connections per dollar invested. The average cost  per connection is approximately US$505 based on the experience from last World Bank-funded projects in  Mozambique.   35.  In the settlements which are being electrified, EDM will also support the new users by providing ready  boards for households that do not have the physical conditions or means to do in-house wiring. This will eliminate  the piecemeal approach that connects each individual household/business/community facility once an individual  application is submitted and the connection fee is paid, a process that is costly and time consuming, and resulting  in the loss of economics of scale.  36.  The project addresses the most important demand-side barrier on electrification projects. The minimum  connection charge has been MZN 3,500 (approximately US$60) and increases with distance to the existing  infrastructure. The connection charge has been unaffordable \u2013 for a large part of the Mozambican population,  even to those living inside EDM\u2019s grid footprint. This is particularly relevant for the FHHs, which face financial  constraints in paying connection fees. The GoM is committed to rationalizing the connection charge as part of the  implementation of Programa Nacional de Energia para Todos. The policy and procedures include removal of the  upfront connection charge. The amount will be publicly known in advance of connection. Resources collected by  EDM through those charges will be allocated to the Electrification Account as per the NES. This arrangement  should not adversely affect EDM\u2019s revenue requirements for covering the cost of operations and maintenance  activities in the newly connected areas, since these costs will be recovered through the electricity bill.   Component B: Off-grid Electrification (US$13 million equivalent from IDA)   Sub-component B.1: Mini-grids (US$10 million equivalent from IDA).   37.  This activity will support the electrification of areas where electricity supply through mini-grids represents  the least-cost option from a country perspective. The locations of mini-grids will be informed by the results of the  Mozambique Geospatial Options Analysis towards Universal Electrification (funded by ESMAP) which includes the  initial site identification made by FUNAE. FUNAE has identified 13 potential mini-grid sites across several districts  in the north of Mozambique to be supplied through combined solar PV and battery storage with a total estimated  capacity of 2.6 MWp and with the potential to reach 7,000 consumers. The proposed project will finance the  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 19 of 84         \n construction of up to six of these mini-grids, adding approximately 4,000 new customers. In the settlements to be  electrified by the mini-grid, the proposed project will connect all potential customers in selected sites, ensuring  economies of scale.  38.  Mini-grids will be developed under a PPP whereby IPPs will invest, operate, and maintain generation  facilities of each mini-grid under PPAs with EDM to be tendered competitively; and the distribution network and  service connections will be public investments financed by the project and operated by EDM. This arrangement  will enhance private participation in rural electrification. FUNAE will contract the design and construction of  distribution network components of the mini-grid and supervise implementation activities. The infrastructure  built by FUNAE will be transferred to EDM for service delivery and O&M.21 Therefore, the new beneficiaries of  mini-grids will become EDM\u2019s consumers and face the national uniform tariff.    39.  The mini-grids will be implemented in a phased approach. The first phase will consist of approximately six  sites, selected using defined criteria established in the NES and in collaboration with private investors. In these  sites the PPP concept will be tested. If the approach proves successful, the remaining sites will be implemented in  a similar manner. In order to increase the attractiveness of small solar IPPs, the project could partner with  International Finance Corporation (IFC) in supporting EDM in the competitive procurement and implementation  under IPP arrangements of a portfolio of on-grid and mini-grid systems.   Sub-component B.2: Off-grid results-based financing (RBF) Facility (US$3 million equivalent from IDA).  40.  This sub-component will support the expansion of off-grid energy market in Mozambique with a focus on  selected provinces in the northern region, where the poverty incidence is high.22 The Facility will primarily support  quality-certified SHSs and potentially other energy technologies such as solar water pumps for agriculture and  efficient cooking solutions. The RBF will disburse based on verified results (for example, market entry, sales) by an  independent verification agent, through a Fund Manager, both contracted by FUNAE. Such a facility can offer  financial remuneration for quality verified products creating credibility of such solar products, creating a space for  new entrants, as well as supporting deeper penetration to bottom of the pyramid consumer segments. It is  expected to reach around 18,000 households.   41.  Harnessing the designs of such RBFs in other countries in Africa, this facility will encompass three main  attributes. First, the companies will sell only Lighting Global or equivalent quality-verified products and provide  adequate after-sales service. Currently, the majority of solar product distributors in Mozambique are informal  without business registration and tax payment to the Government. Few solar products are certified by  international standards such as Lighting Africa, and therefore the quality of products in the market vary  significantly. In addition, as many of the product suppliers are not based in Mozambique, product warrantee or  customer support is very scarce. Second, the companies will be provided incentives for the poorest districts in the  selected regions. Such geographic targeting will also help direct the companies into areas where distribution  channels are more difficult to establish, and affordability concerns are more pronounced. Third, the RBF payments  will be structured to support up-front cost of market entry for new players. This will allow a more dynamic market  condition \u2013 RBF could pay for initial set-up, consumer awareness, training of sales agents etc. FUNAE will retain  consultancy services to manage the RBF since this is the first of such opportunity. The RBF will be managed by an                                               21 In order to ensure that the quality of service meets applicable standards, EDM may outsource the O&M of network assets, and retail  services to qualified private contractors through an O&M contract.  22 The pilot provinces will be agreed in consultation with the GoM and FUNAE. Nampula and Zambezi are considered strong candidates for  their large population and high population density. These two provinces are also identified as regional priority in CPF.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 20 of 84         \n independent Fund Manager with high standards of transparency and integrity. After the project closing, the facility  may continue to operate under FUNAE.    42.  The facility will complement the ongoing efforts by DPs to incentivize the off-grid market with grant and  working capital facilities to address barriers. Several DPs (for example, Sweden, United Kingdom and EnDev) are  presently supporting the off-grid space in Mozambique, but the support is fragmented partly due to the lack of  GoM\u2019s strategic vision and institutional capacity in this space. The project will contribute to strengthen the donor  coordination and equip FUNAE with an instrument to strategically support off-grid electrification.  Component C: Technical Assistance and Implementation Support (US$9 million equivalent from IDA)   Sub-component C.1: Technical Assistance to EDM (US$6 million).   43.  This subcomponent will mainly finance: (a) Capacity building and implementation support for EDM, for  project management expenses such as the financing of external audit, oversight of implementation including the  environmental and safeguards instruments for the investments, oversight of the health and safety aspects during  construction, as well as enhancement of procurement procedures and material logistics; (b) Community  Engagement Program this includes: connection campaign, which will be gender-sensitive, to inform people in  target areas of the cost of electricity services, uniformed payment for electricity connection to be paid in  installments without any up-front payment, procedures and safety practices of the electrification process and  support the ongoing community reach out program of EDM which empowers a network of community agents in  the beneficiary areas with the objective to reduce illegal connections; (c) Young professional program at EDM, to  support EDM\u2019s efforts in building the new generation workforce in the company by competitively selecting  technical specialists to support key business areas of the utility, while receiving hands-on training organized in  conjunction with EDM\u2019s Academy; and (d) Gender mainstreaming in EDM to increase gender participation in the  company through specific initiatives launch by EDM\u2019s human resources department (training, gender equality and  justice policies, Gender Equality Seal, awareness campaign material).   Sub-component C.2: Technical Assistance to FUNAE (US$3 million).  44.  This activity will support project management-related expenses such as the financing of external audit,  oversight of implementation of the environmental and safeguard instruments for the investment components, as  well as the oversight of health and safety aspects during construction and operation. In addition, FUNAE, with  support from contracted consultants, will develop a business strategy aligned with the roles it has been assigned  under the NES. Also, this activity will support capacity building and consultancy services related to the  development of Lighting Global quality standards for SHSs; and creation and implementation of a facility manager  as well as the procurement of an independent verification agency for the RBF facility.  Project Cost and Financing  45.  The project will be a regular Investment Project Financing (IPF) with a duration of five years. It will be  funded through an IDA grant with joint co-financing for Component A in the form of a grant from a new MDTF  that has been established. Table 2 below is indicative and all expenditures under Component A will be shared  between the IDA grant and the MDTF grant.   46.  It is expected that grant resources, in an indicative total amount of US$66 million for the Recipient- executed portion, will be secured and be available for joint co-financing. The grant agreement will be signed based  on the contributions received into the MDTF.23 Additional grant resources will then be passed on to the                                               23 As of January 30, 2019, the MDTF has an available balance of US$2.725 million (equivalent).  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 21 of 84         \n Government as and when they are received without the need to process a restructuring or additional financing.  In case the co-financing does not materialize or is less than expected, either additional resources will be sought  potentially through an IDA additional financing mechanism or the project will be restructured to be  proportionately scaled down.

The project direct beneficiaries will be around 272,000 new customers provided with electricity services  (through grid, mini-grids and stand-alone SHS) including households (close to 1.45 million people representing  almost 5 percent of the population), enterprises and public facilities (800). The beneficiaries will replace  consumption of kerosene and alternative fuels. Around half of the new connections will be made in the five  poorest provinces of Mozambique \u2013 Niassa, Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado and Sofala. More than 85,000  connections are expected to be made in Nampula. Around 74 percent of the beneficiaries are in districts deemed  rural by the 2017 census. Therefore, provision of electricity service could have a profound impact on these  communities. The new procurement approach24 is conducive to harness local capabilities for the supply and  installation of the final connections to new clients where local and private participation are better placed given  the national wide footprint of the project. Private participation can also take place in generation and operation  and management of the isolated systems.  48.  The project will also incentivize the commercialization of the SHS in selected areas of the country through  an RBF approach. This pilot facility is expected to provide direct benefits to 4,000 households connected to mini- grids and 18,000 households and will benefit private companies by expanding the customer base for SHSs.                                                24 Bulk supply versus turn key contract.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 22 of 84         \n D. Role of Partners  49.  The proposed project represents a coordinated effort of the DPs to implement the NES. Such an effort  could harmonize procedures for faster implementation and establish a pipeline of projects to support on-grid and  off-grid electrification efforts in Mozambique for about US$240 million across both grid and off-grid. Recognizing  the need to harmonize and simplify procedures independently of the sources of financing, the Government of  Norway the World Bank have established a Trust Fund at the scale of US$66 million (including the indicative  contribution of the Government of Sweden and EC) administrated by the World Bank for on-grid electrification.  This will facilitate the implementation of the electrification program and will ensure that resources fully support  the implementation of the NES.  E. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design  50.  Fostering cost effective electrification. The design of the project benefitted from lessons learned by  similar utilities in the region which have embarked on successful electrification programs. EDM and FUNAE had  the opportunity to exchange ideas with key stakeholders who implemented the largely successful electrification  program in Kenya. Through this exchange, the following key successful features about an innovative approach for  the procurement of activities related to electrification services has been extensively discussed and adopted for  the project, which replaces the use of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractors for the  separate procurement of (a) materials in bulk and (b) engineering and construction services. This will require  additional work for EDM, but it is expected to achieve a lower cost per connection due to the large economies of  scale in the procurement of materials in bulk.  51.  Electrification is supported by least-cost plans using geospatial information. Following recent Sub- Saharan African experience in Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, Geographic Information System (GIS) least cost  planning tools have become best practice in electrification planning. Geospatial least cost plans provide a powerful  tool to the policy maker to balance the need to maximize the efficient use of limited public resources with the  objective of providing equal opportunities to those living in areas far away from the existing grid. At the same  time, geospatial plans allow for identifying communities that may require pre-electrification solutions in the short- to-mid-term while waiting for higher service standard connections.   52.  Addressing long term sustainability of peri-urban and rural on-grid services. The lessons learned from  the analytical work on geospatial electrification access planning shows that anchor loads in rural areas and  prioritizing the grid-based electrification of the areas with medium to large scale productive uses of electricity is  a critical success factor. Therefore, prioritizing the electrification of target areas based on potential demand from  existing or planned anchor loads (for example, industrial applications, irrigation schemes, and commercial farming  zones) could offset the grid-extension and O&M cost recovery through the uniform nationwide tariff structure,  and could contribute to the sustainability of grid-based electrification in peri-urban and rural areas. EDM\u2019s  prioritization and sequencing of grid extensions will be informed by the outputs from the options study on  geospatial electricity access.   53.  Deploying mini-grids where the main grid will not reach in a timely manner and integrating productive  uses in design are key success factors for decentralized electrification. Grid-compatible mini grids under this  project will be built where: (a) the main grid will not reach in the foreseeable future; and (b) stand-alone off- grid  electrifications do not meet the energy needs of productive users of electricity in local communities in a cost- effective manner. The mini-grids under this project will be constructed with provisions for merging with the main  grid if-and-when the national grid is extended to the same area, thus mitigating the risk of stranded assets.  In  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 23 of 84         \n terms of site-selection for mini-grids, the project is coordinated with other development projects to ensure  responsiveness to the demands from irrigation and agriculture projects among others, and to improve the  financial sustainability of the mini-grid operations based on revenues from productive uses of mini-grid electricity.   54.  Gender-sensitive consumers awareness campaigns are important tools for the safe use of electricity.  Experience in several Sub-Saharan African countries show that gender-sensitive consumers awareness campaigns  are important to educate \u2013 both males and females \u2013 in the benefits, correct use and payment of electricity  (whether provided by on-grid or off-grid services). Given women under recognized role in the households as  energy providers and managers, ensuring they have sufficient information on connection procedures, costs,  consumer rights, safety etc. is key to enhancing their agency as customer. As part of these campaigns, additional  consultative meetings are usually held with women only to provide an environment which invites women to  openly raise questions, situation that may be unlikely to happen if the meeting is developed in a large, mixed  group. Partnerships will be explored with relevant groups and stakeholders that have community knowledge and  presence, including the energy committees and the community agents operating under the Community  Engagement Program of EDM, to enhance the delivery of consumer information by EDM and FUNAE in local  contexts.  55.  Strengthening implementation readiness. The execution of large infrastructure works with World Bank- financing in Mozambique has often been delayed given the lack of implementation readiness at the time of project  effectiveness. To mitigate the risk of implementation delays in the investment components, the World Bank is  supporting EDM and FUNAE (through PERIP) with the advance preparation of (a) power distribution network  standards and material specifications; (b) identification of potential project sites; and (c) environmental and social  safeguards assessments.   56.  Enhancing contract processing and FM. To mitigate the risk of delays in the processing of contracts and  payment procedures, certain measures have been agreed between the World Bank and the GoM at portfolio level.  Relevant to this project are: (a) to exempt contracts with a prior review from the World Bank from further Tax  Authority approvals before execution and (b) to use Designated Accounts (DAs) instead of the Single Treasury  Account. Further to this, the risk of exchange rate losses, which affected several projects in the past, will be  mitigated by allowing the project implementation units (PIUs) to keep transferred funds in a U S dollar account.  III. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS  A. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  57.  EDM will be responsible for the implementation of Component A and C.1. FUNAE will be responsible for  the implementation of Components B and C.2.  58.  EDM will define the areas to be electrified based on technical and policy development priorities provided  by MIREME. EDM, the PIU will be under the Directorate of Social Energy (Direc\u00e7\u00e3o de Energia Social, DES)25, a  newly formed unit in EDM to lead electrification projects. The PIU is led by a Director and is supplemented with  additional staff given the size of the project portfolio it manages, including the ongoing PERIP. Using this  arrangement will allow EDM to capitalize on the long-standing experience and capacity to implement World Bank  financed projects.  59.  EDM is undergoing institutional reforms to address the challenges in the sector and better take advantage  of the existing resources. The Environmental and Social Safeguards Unit will be a critical unit to ensure full                                               25 This department was formerly known as Direccao de Electrificacao e Projectos.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 24 of 84         \n compliance with World Bank safeguards requirements during the implementation of this project. The staff of this  unit will be responsible for (a) carrying out social and environmental audits; (b) supervising social and  environmental consultants; (c) guiding the Project Manager on major social and environmental issues; (d)  preparing terms of reference for environmental consultants; (e) monitoring the implementation of the  Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and any  Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) or abbreviated RAPs,  (ARAP) as applicable; (f) liaising with EDM\u2019s Distribution Areas in the targeted provinces, in coordination with the  Safety, Health and Environmental Directorate in EDM, to ensure fulfillment of social and environmental standards  for utilities in the distribution areas; and (g) liaising with MIREME.  60.  EDM is also undergoing a Supply Chain Reform, which intends to elevate the quality of procurement and  inventory supply and management practices to international best practices. This reform will further strengthen  PIU\u2019s compliance with World Bank procurement requirements during the implementation of this project. The  reform is being driven by the newly structured Procurement and Logistics Directorate, and entails: (a)  centralization and normalization of procurement practices, guided by new regulations and international  standards; (b) refurbishment and optimization of warehousing capacity, to ensure optimal and safe storage of  stocks; (c) optimization and possible upgrade of the Logistics module for Contract and Inventory management and  controls; and (d) redesign of the transportation network for optimality of timing and costs in supplies. The capacity  of the staff of the new directorate will be enhanced through tailored training.   61.  FUNAE will be responsible for Component B and C.2. FUNAE has experience in implementing World Bank  financed projects, with the recent work on \u201cInvestments on Rural and Renewable Energy Component\u201d under the  EDAP. Maintaining and strengthening the existing project management structure will enable FUNAE to capitalize  on the experience accumulated and reduce implementation risks.  B. Results Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements  62.  The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the project will be carried out by the EDM PIU and FUNAE PIU  for their respective components. Both PIUs will prepare semi-annual reports to be discussed at EDM\u2019s Senior  Management level and periodically with the institutions\u2019 Board. The semi-annual progress reports will be  submitted to the World Bank. These reports will include results indicators, as well as reporting on the  implementation of the ESMP, RAP, Health and Safety Plans. Section VI presents the project\u2019s Results Framework,  which defines specific outcomes and results to be monitored.  63.  The proposed project contemplates the procurement of supervision consultants hired by EDM and  FUNAE, for their respective components, who will support the implementing agencies in preparing progress  reports and evaluating the progress of the works implemented by the contractors. An independent verification  agent will be hired to monitor the connections made under the results-based financing facility (Component C.2).  64.  Multi-tier Framework (MTF) Surveys at baseline and closing will contribute to estimate the quality of  energy access. The MTF, developed by the Global Tracking Framework of Sustainable Energy for All,26 moves  beyond the traditional binary way of defining electrification to adopt a tiered definition (Tier 1 to Tier 5) based on  the attributes of energy service such as affordability, reliability, legality, and so on. The survey will provide key  insights into supply alternatives that households are using and will provide additional demand data on energy- related expenditure, as well as into user preferences and satisfaction with service.                                                26 http://trackingenergy4all.worldbank.org/  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 25 of 84         \n C. Sustainability  65.  Government ownership. Global experience on successful electrification program points to Government  ownership as a vital element. In Mozambique, the emerging consensus on the NES and geospatial mapping  suggests the Government\u2019s determination to translate aspirations to action. The Government\u2019s target is to achieve  universal access to electricity by 2030. To achieve this, EDM needs to implement on average 450,000 new  connections per year. Such a scaled-up endeavor requires an increase in financial and human resources of the  utility which is expected to grow at an exponential rate. The Government is clear about the economic, social and  political benefits of sustaining development of the power sector and is fully committed to do so. The National  Electrification Strategy was approved on October 2018 by the Council of Ministers, but the Government is going  beyond the Strategy through the implementation of a comprehensive national electrification program, the  \u201cPrograma Nacional de Energia para Todos\u201d.  66.  Financial sustainability. Given the financial constraints of the country, the Government will contribute  with limited resources in the first years of the program. However, they are expected to make financial  contributions as the electrification program develops and according to the NES, which indicates an allocation from  taxes collected from power concessioners. On the investment side, EDM and FUNAE will be provided with  financing for executing projects for electrification. These investments will not be reflected in EDM\u2019s accounts  contributing to the financial sustainability of the utility. Additionally, a new pilot program will be launched to  attract private participation for individual energy solutions for off-grid. With considerable recognition of the large  needs, the DPs co-financing the proposed project have made their financing available in the form of a grant to the  Government which is expected to be passed on to EDM under the same grant terms. On the operational cost, the  Government has contributed by supporting EDM in the increase of tariffs by 107 percent in the past three years,  with the objective of reaching domestic tariffs that will cover cost of services. This will enable EDM to continue to  operate commercially while serving low consuming customers.   67.  Commercial sustainability. The project builds on the recent World Bank-financed PERIP that supports the  improvement of operational performance of the company, with focus on quality of electricity supply, commercial  operations (revenue cycle, prepayment), and customer service. Financing is also provided for network  infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrade, consolidation of use of management information systems that support  operations and key business areas of the utility. The commercial sustainability of electricity services depends on  actual improvement of EDM\u2019s operational performance through implementation of actions in PERIP. This will  provide the foundation for a successful development of an ambitious electrification program in the country that  will incorporate around three times more new clients and provide quality services to existing and new consumers.  68.  Institutional sustainability. Both EDM and FUNAE are undergoing institutional reforms which will better  position them to implement and operate fast growing systems. These institutional reforms are equally important  to ensure system sustainability during operations. For the off-grid systems, the proposed project envisages  appointing O&M services to private companies who will be responsible for system operation, equipment  replacements, billing and all other necessary actions that will ensure continuous operations. For the on-grid  systems, the project will complement ongoing reforms and initiatives such as procurement reform, digitalization,  organizational reform and staff management, gender promotion, etc, which are partly financed under PERIP, and  by other DPs.  69.  Social sustainability. The target beneficiary population, who will benefit from the increased access is  expected to value their benefits and thus contribute to maintaining the investments and therefore to sustain the  development outcomes overtime. This beneficiary engagement is being enhanced through a Customer Awareness  Campaign and Satisfaction Survey. Consumer awareness campaigns provide useful information to new consumers  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 26 of 84         \n in unelectrified areas on the different uses of electricity, connection type and costs. This allows new customers to  make better informed decisions which usually translates to increased electricity demand and sustainability of such  connection. The Community Engagement Program launched by EDM in 2017, called \u201cEDM com a Comunidade\u201d  will also be engaged as a platform for dialogue and awareness campaigns, focusing not only on new connections  but also on loss reduction, the prevention of vandalism of infrastructure and energy theft, and an increased  awareness of potential risks of accidents and injury in the electrical networks.  IV. PROJECT APPRAISAL SUMMARY  \n A. Technical, Economic and Financial Analysis  Technical  70.  The project includes works and equipment related to: (a) Electrification Program; and (b) Technical  Assistance. The project presents no unusual construction and operational challenges as the concept of  electrification is well known and proven in Mozambique. However, the project introduces modern power  distribution technologies optimized technical designs to increase system efficiency. In previous years, EDM used  Aerial Bundled Conductors to connect new low voltage customers, this is unusual in low income countries with a  low electrification rate. The project is expected to improve this scenario by investing in new connections using  bare conductors which are cost efficient and provide the same level of service to the customer. In areas where  the conditions permit,27 the project will implement the SWER. This technology is expected to be used instead of  the long distribution lines which are subject to higher installation costs with higher technical losses.   71.  The design also considers improved efficiencies in distribution system operation. The project will finance  smaller distribution transformers, which have lower technical losses than the large transformers that EDM  normally uses. Each new customer will have a pre-payment meter installed which is monitored in the Customer  Management System to ensure that all new customers are monitor through a centralize system. At the household  level, the project will fund the installation of ready boards in households without internal wiring to ensure safe  and efficient use of electricity for the customer.  72.  The mini-grid distribution networks will be designed and constructed following the same design principles  as the on-grid distribution networks. This is to ensure that all mini-grids deliver reliable service and are capable to  connect to the national grid at a later stage. The generation component of the mini-grid will be sized to allow a  considerable amount of load growth, which will be stimulated by the foreseen economic activities that electricity  will facilitate in these communities. The combination of solar PV and batteries is expected to provide pre-defined  level of electricity services, which is equivalent to grid services.    Economic Analysis  73.  The GoM\u2019s vision for universal electricity access in the country by 2030 calls for major investments in both  on-grid and off-grid solutions. Grid electricity access in rural areas is generally considered to be financially unviable  for utilities like EDM, due to the high costs of the grid extension to these areas as well as limited revenue prospects  from low-income consumers. Therefore, public funding is needed to reduce the financial burden of EDM in  expanding the grid network to rural customers.   74.  Development of mini-grid solutions in Mozambique also faces the challenge of cost recovery, due to the  limited prospect of revenue from low-income customers due to relatively low level of consumption and GoM\u2019s                                               27 Densely populated communities, far away from the existing distribution network, with suitable ground conditions.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 27 of 84         \n universal tariff policy. For this reason, the GoM\u2019s NES, identified the optimal approach for mini-grid development  in Mozambique as to maximize the public funds to leverage private participation in the generation segment. In  this regard, small generation plants are expected to be tendered competitively and with a PPA with EDM, while  the network facility will be financed with public funding (by FUNAE). Once the mini-grid is in operation, new clients  will be transferred to EDM, which may choose to outsource the operation of the mini-grids to private sector. Public  funding is, therefore, needed to provide the necessary CAPEX for the mini-grids and to keep the electricity  affordable for the mini-grid users.   75.  The World Bank is well-positioned to support Mozambique in its endeavor to accelerate increased  electricity access. The World Bank has supported off-grid solution development in other Sub-Saharan African  countries including Zambia, Niger, Ethiopia and Kenya to name a few. Lessons and technical expertise from these  existing operations can be used for the benefit of the project. In Mozambique, the World Bank has supported  GoM\u2019s preparation of the NES and has provided financial support for the EDAP.   76.  The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 3. The project demonstrated its economic  viability with economic internal rate of return (EIRR) at 17.4 percent and net present value (NPV) of US$84.2  million (at 7 percent discount rate). The result is strengthened when global environmental benefits through  greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement are included. The project is expected to result in net emission reduction of  approximately 4.9 million tCO2 over the project\u2019s economic life over 25 years.   Table 3. Results of the Economic Analysis  \n EIRR (%)  NPV  Without GHG  17.4  US$84.2 million  With GHG   29.5  US$187.0 million  \n Financial Analysis  \n 77.  Since 2014, the expansion in Mozambique\u2019s generation capacity was developed through gas fired IPPs  that signed PPAs with EDM, with prices set on hard currency. The entry into operation of these plants transformed  EDM\u2019s energy balance, modifying significantly the unit cost of generation. This shift in the generation mix towards  thermal generation had a profound impact on average generation costs, increasing from US$c3.2/kWh in 2014 to  US$c6.2/kWh in 2017. This negative impact on costs was even further exacerbated during the rapid devaluation  of the monthly household (MT) that followed the macroeconomic crisis of 2016.   78.  Despite a tariff increase of over 100 percent during the same period, the sharp increase in energy  purchases severely affected EDM\u2019s financial sustainability. Earnings before interest and tax, depreciation, and  amortization (EBITDA) showed a sharp decrease during the period 2014 \u2013 2017, mainly driven by tariff increases  that were not sufficient to cover the increase in the energy purchase costs and fixed costs, affecting as a  consequence EDM\u2019s margins for transmission and distribution activities. In 2017, EBITDA turned negative,  highlighting EDM\u2019s difficulties in controlling its cost structure evolution.   79.  EDM is currently over-leveraged, with most of its financial debt denominated in foreign currency. This  situation limits its ability to deliver on the future expansion plan of the company and capex execution required to  improve the quality of service and meet the forecasted energy demand.  80.  FSP. Cognizant of this situation, EDM with support from the World Bank started, in 2017, the preparation  of a Cost of Service Study that provided the analytical foundations for the development of a comprehensive FSP.  Based on the recommendations from this study, GoM, MIREME and EDM are taking specific measures as part of  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 28 of 84         \n the FSP. The FSP includes: (a) performance contract of EDM through the implementation of PERIP\u2019s Component 2  to reduce system losses, from 29 percent in 2018 down to 19 percent in 2024; (b) a recapitalization process of  EDM in line with the recommendations of the Cost of Service Study (50 percent recapitalization); (c) capex for  electricity access projects financed according to the NES; and (d) electricity tariff adjusted in line with domestic  inflation and full pass-through of generation costs.  81.  The results show that EDM should be able to achieve operational breakeven in 2019 and return to  profitability by 2020. In particular, EDM\u2019s return on capital invested (RoIC) is expected to rapidly recover to 4.3  percent in 2021 while Return on Equity (RoE) should reach 6.2 percent in 2022. Financial liquidity and leverage  ratios are expected to improve as part of the debt recapitalization process. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is  expected to achieve sustainable values by 2021. Current ratio, nonetheless, may take a bit longer to reach  sustainable figures (it will be only >1 by 2023) but that is largely dependent on Mozambique\u2019s ability to collect  receivables from Zambia\u2019s utility. Further details of the financial analysis are presented in Annex 3.  B. Fiduciary  (i) Financial Management  \n 82.  An FM assessment was conducted according to World Bank IPF Policy and Directive. Its objective was to  determine whether EDM and FUNAE have acceptable and adequate FM arrangements to (a) ensure that funds  are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical way while implementing agreed activities;  (b) enable the preparation of accurate and timely financial reports; (c) ensure that funds are properly managed  and flow smoothly, rapidly, adequately, regularly, and predictably; (d) enable project management to monitor the  efficient implementation of the project; and (e) safeguard the project\u2019s assets and resources.  83.  The conclusion of the review of the proposed FM arrangements was that the overall residual FM risk rating  of the project is Substantial. EDM will need to implement mitigating measures to the identified risks, including the  updating of World Bank-related procedures of the already existing FM Procedures Manual (part of the Project  Implementation Manual), and register the project and its components in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).  The external audit will be under the responsibility of the same private auditor in charge of auditing EDM entity  financial statements, who will be recruited within three months of effectiveness. The proposed FM arrangements,  as summarized in Annex 1, meet the requirements for FM under World Bank IPF Policy and Directive, and  therefore, are able to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the  project as required by the World Bank (IDA). Similar mitigation actions need to be implemented at FUNAE.   (ii) Procurement  \n 84.  Procurement arrangements. The proposed procurement activities for the project will be managed  independently by the main beneficiaries: EDM through the DES and FUNAE through their UGEA (procurement  unit). EDM has a generally long-standing experience with the World Bank in the implementation of several World  Bank funded operations. Furthermore, EDM also has experience in the implementation and management of other  DPs\u2019 projects. DES is also currently managing a World Bank funded project and the available expertise will be  instrumental for synergies into the implementation of the proposed project. The undergoing procurement reform,  driven by the newly created Procurement and Logistics Directorate, will aim at centralizing and normalizing  procurement practices to an internationally recognized quality standard, and will support and sustain  procurement activities under this project and the project team. FUNAE was involved into the implementation of  the EDAP and, thus, possesses some experience with the World Bank procurement procedures.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 29 of 84         \n 85.  Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) Summary. The two implementing agencies  prepared their respective PPSDs. The PPSDs have informed the initial procurement plan and the procurement  approaches to be used for the key procurement activities. While the project proposes an innovative approach for  electrification (by replacing the use of EPC contractors for the separate procurement of materials in bulk and  engineering and construction services), the envisaged contracts are not complex in nature and do not require the  adoption of innovative or complex approaches beyond the capacity available in the two implementing Agencies.  86.  Procurement capacity. The procurement capacity within EDM is satisfactory. The team that will be in  charge of the implementation has been involved with the recently closed EDAP. In addition, they will have cross  support from the team that is implementing another World Bank funded operation, the PERIP, and the  Procurement Reform team, DAL. The risk associated with EDM for the implementation of the project is therefore,  Moderate. FUNAE was also involved with the implementation of a component under the EDAP, although not  through the current UGEA, and the envisaged activities under this project are of similar nature and also similar to  other activities that FUNAE does implement with other sources of funding, hence the risk for the FUNAE  component is rated as Substantial.    87.  Procurement for the proposed operation will be carried out in accordance with the \u2018World Bank\u2019s  Procurement Regulations for Borrowers under IPF\u2019, dated July 1, 2016, revised August 2018, and the provisions  stipulated in the Financing Agreement. Furthermore, the \u2018Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and  Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants\u2019, dated October 15, 2006, and revised  in January 2011 and July 2016, will apply.   88.  Current country practices for making payments abroad may also affect the performance of the  procurement function of the project, as substantial delays are occurring throughout the portfolio. In addition,  the fulfillment of the requirements of the Attorney General\u2019s office and the Administrative Tribunal may lead to  delays for contract signing, after the completion of the evaluation process and of the contract award. It is  instrumental that the time required for the processing by the Administrative Court (Tribunal Administrativo, TA)  is carefully taken into consideration in the activities planning process.  89.  The overall procurement risk associated with the project in view of the risks indicated above and the  experience of previous World Bank-financed projects is Substantial.  C. Safeguards  (i)  Environmental Safeguards  90.  The project will have positive environmental impacts. The electrification program will help to displace the  use of kerosene for lighting by the connection of the household to electricity services. Access to electricity service  will also displace small diesel generators used by businesses. There are no significant and/or irreversible adverse  environmental issues anticipated from the investment for electrification under Component A to be financed under  the project.  Civil works will lead to relatively minor air and water pollution during the construction phases and,  once the works are completed, limited loss of non-critical animal and plant habitats. Component B (off-grid  electrification using renewable energy) will have low to moderate negative impacts on the environment,  depending on their locations. The major environmental and public health risks might arise from improper disposal  of SHSs batteries to be handled by private companies. An ESMF was prepared by the Borrower, to set forth  mechanisms for screening, supervision and monitoring during implementation, including clear roles and  responsibilities of client contractors and supervisors including a proposal of institutional strengthening program  for EDM and FUNAE. The ESMF comprises a generic ESMP and subset of guidelines and code of conduct for  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 30 of 84         \n implementers. Both ESMF and ESMPs have been consulted upon28 and publicly disclosed. The Client submited the  ESMF on December, 1, 2018 for World Bank review and approval. The ESMF has been disclosed by the Client and  the World Bank (in their respective websites) on January 25, 2019.  91.  The following safeguard policies are triggered: (OP/BP 4.01) on Environmental Assessment, (OP/BP 4.04)  on Natural Habitats, (OP/BP 4.11) on Physical Cultural Resources, and (OP/BP 4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement.  OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats was triggered, because the project may include civil works with potential negative  impacts on natural habitats (coil, water, mainly), demanding specific provision on natural habitats, included in the  proposed ESMF. Although the project will not be involved in major civil works of large movements of earth in  areas containing sites deemed physical cultural resources, to ensure due diligence, chance find procedures are  included in the ESMF to address OP/BP 4.11 basic requirements. The project will not support activities in areas  with known physical cultural resources. No civil works within a river that is classified as an International Waterway  (under OP7.50, International Waterways) or a tributary to such a river will be eligible for funding.  92.  The Borrower\u2019s institutional capacity for safeguards management has increased during the past years.  EDM has recently executed two World Bank financed projects (the EDAP \u2013 P108444 and the Power Efficiency and  Reliability Improvement Project \u2013 P158249), gaining experience on the World Bank safeguards policies. The ESMF  included the environmental and social management roles and responsibilities of the contractors and the  supervision engineers, as well as a proposal of institutional strengthening program considering ongoing and  proposed activities by EDM that could potentially stretch out its safeguards capacity and staffing.  (ii) Social Safeguards  93.  The project will have positive social benefits. By connecting people to electricity in peri-urban and rural  areas, the project will promote economic growth and equity through electrification of low-income households. All  infrastructure investments in Component A will be at existing electricity network infrastructure (that is, at existing  EDM\u2019 substations and lines). There will be no land acquisition and no involuntary resettlement for these  components. The works under Component A are composed of construction of medium voltage (MV) and low  voltage (LV) lines. The MV and LV lines do not require land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement of  households. The anticipated social impacts will be minimal and might involve compensation for crops and or/trees  which could be damaged during way leave acquisition. In the case of Sub-component B.1, this component will  require land acquisition for mini-grid in relation to the generation facilities. Once locations are known, a RAP will  be prepared including the specifics of each location. After review by the Bank, EDM and FUNAE disclosed the ESMF  on January 25, 2019. The RPF has been disclosed by the Client (in its websites) on January 23, 2019 and by the  World Bank in its website on January 17, 2019.  (iii)  Gender  94.  In Mozambique, FHHs represents 36 percent of all households and are more likely to fall below the poverty  line than male-headed households.29 Furthermore, rural FHH are the most marginalized and excluded, with lack  of secure rights to housing and other key resources. Thus, providing non-discriminatory access to electricity and  gender-sensitive information on the benefits of electricity represents an important step forward in the creation  of the necessary conditions required to curve the gender gap.   95.  EDM conducted a general review about women participation in EDM\u2019s operations by the end of 2017. The  results indicated that women represent 17 percent of the work force and 40 percent of them perform activities  related to their training areas, 25 percent of women work on technical areas, 57 percent have a university degree,                                               28 The ESMF and RPF were consulted on November 21, 2018 at Boane District Head Office.  29 Inqu\u00e9rito Demogr\u00e1fico e de Sa\u00fade (2011).  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 31 of 84         \n 34 percent have an undergraduate degree and 9 percent basic education. Around 50 percent of the women have  at least 12 years of service at EDM. One out of four Executive Board Members is a woman. EDM is carrying out a  gender audit to assess the challenges in terms of gender participation, diversity and equality and based on the  results, will formulate a corporate gender strategy with the view to achieve at least 40 percent Gender Index by  year 2030.   96.  To advance women participation in the workforce, EDM has initiated the following programs: (a)  increased awareness among the next generation workforce of potential economic activities or jobs through the  \u201cBring your Daughter to Work\u201d program; (b) conduct outreach to high-school level educational institutions that  leads to long-term attraction of both male and female job candidates; (c) organize technical visits to generation  or substation facilities for women in EDM's workforce, to increase their understanding of the business; (d) increase  women participation among management positions, through the introduction of gender targets in the competitive  selection processes; (e) preferential hiring for technical positions recently advertised (ex. Central Terminal de  Maputo); and (f) creation of a young professionals program. The project will support part of the implementation  of the gender strategy (Engendering EDM), driven by the Human Resources Directorate (POG) in coordination with  other DPs. In addition, the project will ensure that at least 30 percent of the candidates hired in the young  professional program are women, thereby closing a gender gap at the institutional level given the current baseline  of only 25 percent of all EDM women working in technical areas.  (iv)  Gender Based Violence (GBV)  97.  The contextual risk for GBV in Mozambique is high similarly to other sub-Saharan countries. According to  the 2015 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), more than one in three women (37.2 percent) have experienced  physical or sexual violence at some point in their lifetime, with higher rates (42.8 percent) found among young  women aged 20-24 in Mozambique. Mozambique also has the 10th highest early marriage rate in the world with  almost half (48 percent) of women aged 20-24 married before age 18 (55.7 percent in rural areas and 36.1 percent  in urban areas), and the percent of young girls aged 20-24 that were married before turning 15 was as high as 14.3  percent. Taking into consideration the contextual issues, the GBV risk assessment tool was applied to the project  to identify necessary mitigation measures that need to be included as per the World Bank\u2019s Good Practice Note  (GPN). Also, GBV risks and identification measures have been included in the ESMF including the need for capacity  building activities of the project implementation unit and code of conduct for contractors. Additional GBV  activities as outlined in the GPN will be integrated during project implementation, such as code of conduct for  contractors, training for PIU, etc.    (v)  Citizen Engagement  98.  As the project deals with providing electricity services to unelectrified consumers, it is key for the project  beneficiaries \u2014citizens\u2014 to properly understand the benefits, safety aspects and commercial aspects of the new  service to be provided. The project supports interventions to inform citizens on the safe use of electricity to reduce  misuse and ensure appropriate care of the products. Gender-sensitive awareness campaign and information  dissemination will be made to inform the citizens on the diverse benefits they can get from the electricity service.  These local community events will be organized under the umbrella of the Community Engagement Program,  \u201cEDM com a Comunidade\u201d, and coordinated with the PIU. As customers are connected to the services, they will  be incorporated into the Customer Management System (CMS) of EDM as the formal platform for electricity\u2019s  users to provide feedback on the services provided, which is recorded and correction measure is generated to  improve the services.   \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 32 of 84         \n (vi) Grievance Redress Mechanisms  99.  Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by a World Bank (WB)  supported project may submit complaints to existing project-level grievance redress mechanisms or the WB\u2019s  Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to  address project-related concerns. Project affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the  WB\u2019s independent Inspection Panel which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB  non-compliance with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have  been brought directly to the World Bank's attention, and Bank Management has been given an opportunity to  respond. For information on how to submit complaints to the World Bank\u2019s corporate Grievance Redress Service  (GRS), please visit http://www.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/products-and-services/grievance-redress- service. For information on how to submit complaints to the World Bank Inspection Panel, please visit  www.inspectionpanel.org.  100.  As a general project policy, EDM and FUNAE will work proactively to avoid grievances by the community  and workers during the implementation of the proposed ProEnergia project. However, there may be events that  could give rise to complaints. Therefore, a GRM will be established, which will be applicable throughout the project  cycle. The mechanism will be organized systematically using a fixed process in the following sequence: (i) EDM  and FUNAE will disseminate GRM procedures at the project sites and surrounding communities, the locations to  submit complaints will be established and communicated; (ii)  The PIUs and contractors will receive and track  complaints from the PAPs; (iii) The contractor will do a preliminary assessment of the complaint, to decide how  and who will be responsible for resolving the complaint; (iv) the appointed responding agency will issue an initial  response to the complainant within 15 days of receiving the complaint; (v) the responsible officials will investigate  the complaint and develop solution options; (vi) the selected solution will be implemented and monitored, a  confirmation of the solution will be agreed with the complainant in writing; (vii) the responsible officials will carry  out additional actions if the complainant is not satisfied; (viii) lastly the implementation of the GRM is monitored,  evaluated and reported on monthly by the relevant consultant.    \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 33 of 84         \n V. KEY RISKS  \n 101.  The overall risk rating for the project is Substantial. Key risks and mitigation measures are discussed in  the following paragraphs.   102.  Political and governance risk (Substantial). Political and governance risk in the sector could raise concerns  for the project. Lack of sectoral coordination from MIREME to drive electrification efforts, sectoral planning, tariff  policy and funding of critical investments in the sector have prevented EDM and FUNAE from adequately  addressing the electricity access problem in Mozambique in the past. This situation has been further exacerbated  by a combination of rapid increase in the demand for electricity services and the deterioration of the existing  transmission and distribution assets due to lack of funding for proper maintenance, putting additional pressure  on the existing infrastructure.   \u2022  Mitigation. The development of the Nationally Electrification Strategy has brought clarity on the  roles of each institution, including new implementation and financial model for electrification.  Additionally, the GOM has committed to achieve a cost-reflective tariff with an increase of tariff  as in the past two years.  103.  Macroeconomic risk (Substantial). The increase in debt levels, the depreciation of the Mozambique  metical, and external shocks (such as commodity price), have heightened Mozambique\u2019s macroeconomic  vulnerability and exposure to fiscal risk. EDM, like many other state-owned enterprises in Mozambique, is cash  constrained and is struggling to meet current payment obligations. This is putting undue stress on its current  liabilities, with no new sources of working capital. There is limited capacity from the Government to financially  bridge or remedy these short-term issues. This situation warrants a financial strengthening plan for EDM agreed  with the Ministry of Economy and Finance.   \u2022  Mitigation. Macroeconomic risks are being mitigated through policy dialogue and technical  assistance through the study of \u2018Cost of Electricity Services\u2019, which aims at (a) establishing the  actual cost of electricity to be recognized through the tariff; (b) establishing a tariff methodology  to carry out adjustments; and (c) analyzing the options for EDM\u2019s FSP.   104.  Sector strategies and policies (Substantial). Lack of adequate tariff regulation, sectoral planning, and  funding of critical investments in the sector has prevented EDM from expansion of access to customers to a level  of earlier years. Adding a great number of clients in a short period of time will impact in system reliability sooner  or later if the company is not well prepared. Even if new clients have low consumption at the beginning, their  increasing number and growth of consumption per client once they have the service may impact in system  reliability if upstream investments do not accompany this demand growth. Although more cost-effective  technologies like SWER as well as technical standards are known and implemented by EDM, they are not  extensively utilized to reduce electrification costs. Also, the GoM pursued investments in generation that do not  follow a least-cost option from the country perspective, significantly affecting the sector efficiency.   \u2022  Mitigation. On the regulatory side, the formation of ARENE will allow for more transparent  regulatory process in the country; the World Bank is currently supporting ARENE as part of the  technical assistance provided on the PERIP. Planning will be improved in the medium-term  through the geospatial least cost electrification roll-out currently underway. The planning will be  informed by recommendations for standards of least-cost technologies, which is part of the  ESMAP study.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 34 of 84         \n 105.  Institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability (Substantial). While EDM is experienced in  implementing large capital investments in transmission and distribution system expansion and upgrade financed  by the World Bank and other DPs, the capacity of EDM\u2019s existing PIU, which is handling these projects, is stretched  and the project will introduce new procurement arrangement that implies a higher level of management and  supervision by EDM. On the off-grid side, the proposed component will require substantial coordination between  FUNAE and EDM for the implementation of a new business model. From the policy / regulatory side, both MIREME  and ARENE have limited capacity to develop, monitor and enforce the necessary regulation for sustainable power  sector development in Mozambique. These capacity barriers and lack of experience might lead to delays in project  implementation.   \u2022  Mitigation. The enhancements of commercial and operational activities in EDM are currently  being supported by the World Bank through PERIP, near-team financial recovery plan looking  concrete commercial, performance and financial measures to improve financial situation. The  alignment with EDM\u2019s Procurement Reform (DAL), undergoing, will provide additional resources  to the project and will support the project implementation. The same is true for other undergoing  projects, such as digitalization and commercial revamping (PERIP), staff organization (Engendering  EDM and Young professionals) and Community Engagement Program (EDM com a Comunidade).  Additionally, the project will benefit from the technical assistance provided by IFC financed by  Government of Norway, which focuses on increasing capacity in its treasury and risk management  functions on a sustainable basis  106.  Fiduciary risks (Substantial). A recent FM and procurement capacity assessment of EDM and FUNAE was  conducted. The overall conclusion of the assessment was that FM and procurement arrangements are weak, and  thus the fiduciary risk of the project is Substantial.   \u2022  Mitigation. To mitigate this risk EDM and FUNAE will need to implement the following measures:  (a) updating of World Bank-related procedures of the existing FM Procedures Manual (part of the  Project Implementation Manual); (b) customization and adjustment of the existing accounting  software used by EDM to reflect the activities of the project; and (c) appointment of project  external auditors. The FM capacity assessment of EDM will be updated and the FM action plan  discussed and confirmed with EDM, and FUNAE. From the procurement perspective, the project  will benefit from EDM\u2019s Procurement Reform under implementation and dedicated procurement  specialist will be assigned to the project.    107.  Stakeholders (Moderate). The project is composed of co-financing from three DPs to be channeled  through a MDTF. To date, the Government of Norway has signed Trust Fund Agreements with IDA. The  Government of Sweden and EC have s confirmed their support and intent to formalize their commitments by June  2019 following IDA Board approval, after obtaining their internal approvals. There is a low risk associated with  shortfalls in DPs\u2019 co-financing. Under such circumstances, the overall project size may need to be reduced and this  would limit the geographical coverage of the project by reducing the number of connections in peri-urban and  rural areas as identified in the Component A of the project. The EU is one of the contributors to the project, and  co-financing from the EU would need to comply with the Framework Agreement signed between the World Bank  and the EC in 2014.   108.  Climate and Disaster Risks. A climate and disaster risk screening has been carried out for the project.  Mozambique is facing increased frequency of extreme weather events, including droughts, tropical cyclones and  floods. 2015 - 2016 drought, which resulted in major impact in food production and people\u2019s livelihood in  Mozambique, is one of such examples. Coastal areas are home to more than 60 percent of Mozambican  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 35 of 84         \n population and are exposed to sea level rise and intense tropical storms. The project activities, which provides  access to on-grid, mini-grid and off-grid electricity services, may be affected by such natural disasters. To mitigate  such risks, the project will employ higher design standards poles which are more resistant to storms in the prone  areas. On the other hand, access to electricity is expected to strengthen the people\u2019s capacity to cope with natural  disasters through enhanced access to information during such events.   \n  .  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n                                                                                        Page 36 of 84        \n   VI.

EDM will implement Components A and C.1; and FUNAE will implement Components B and C.2.  2.  EDM will implement Component A and C.1 under the DES30 in charge of electrification. Areas to be  electrified based on technical and policy development priorities will be defined by MIREME. EDM management  has assigned dedicated staff from the DES led by a Director and is supplemented with additional staff given the  size of the project portfolio it manages, including the ongoing PERIP, Procurement Reform Program, Engendering  EDM Program, EDM\u2019s Community Engagement Program, EDM\u2019s e-learning initiative, and EDM\u2019s Young  Professionals Program. Using this arrangement will allow EDM to capitalize on the long-standing experience and  capacity to implement World Bank financed projects. The implementation process will follow the activities  presented in the diagram in Figure 1.1.  3.  Warehousing capacity is needed to store and manage the materials and equipment to be used by the  project. EDM\u2019s warehousing and transportation network will be the basis for the constitution of separate storage  capacity and its management, in the logistics module of the ERP (GIAF).                                               30 This department was formerly known as Direccao de Electrificacao e Projectos.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n                                                                                        Page 43 of 84        \n   Figure 1.1.

EDM is undergoing institutional reforms to enable the utility to address the challenges in the sector and  better take advantage of the existing resources. The Environmental and Social Safeguards Unit will be a critical  unit to ensure full compliance with World Bank safeguards requirements during the implementation of this  project. The staff of this unit will be responsible for (a) carrying out social and environmental audits; (b) supervising  social and environmental consultants; (c) guiding the Project Manager on major social and environmental issues;  (d) preparing terms of reference for environmental consultants; (e) monitoring the implementation of the ESMF,  RPF and any ESMPs, RAPs or AAPs, as applicable; (f) liaising with EDM\u2019s Distribution Areas in the targeted provinces  to ensure fulfillment of social and environmental standards for utilities in the distribution areas; and (g) liaising  with MIREME.  5.  The project also benefits from the review of EDM corporate procurement practices financed by  Government of Sweden carried out by Crown Agents. EDM has adopted a new EDM Procurement Regulation to  enhance internal approvals and process with the aim to improve transparency. The project will also follow the  World Bank\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, and will be complemented by the undergoing Procurement Reform, driven  by the Supply and Logistics Directorate.  6.  FUNAE will be responsible for the implementation of the off-grid component (Component B) and Sub- component C.2. FUNAE has experience in implementing World Bank financed projects, with the recent work on  \u201cInvestments on Rural and Renewable Energy Component\u201d under the EDAP. Maintaining and strengthening the  existing project management structure will enable FUNAE to capitalize on the experience accumulated and to  smoothly transition into the implementation of the proposed project.   Financial Management and Disbursement  7.  The World Bank\u2019s FM assessment of EDM and FUNAE concluded that the project\u2019s FM arrangements  meets the World Bank\u2019s minimum requirements under World Bank IPF Policy and Directive. The overall residual  risk rating for the project is Substantial.   8.  The objective of the FM assessment was to determine whether the FM arrangements will; (a) ensure that  funds are used only for their intended purposes in an efficient and economical way while implementing agreed  activities; (b) enable the preparation of accurate and timely financial reports; (c) ensure that funds are properly  managed and flow smoothly, rapidly, adequately, regularly, and predictably; (d) enable project management to  monitor the efficient implementation of the project; and (e) safeguard the project\u2019s assets and resources. The  assessment complied with the FM Manual for World Bank-Financed Investment Operations that became effective  on March 1, 2010 and was revised on February 4, 2015.   Project Financial Management Arrangements   9.  Budgeting arrangements. The budgeting process will need to consider all relevant aspects of the project  and be prepared at least two months before the fiscal year to which it pertains. The DES, in close coordination  with other relevant units of EDM, will prepare budget activities which will be captured in annual work plans, which  will need to be submitted to IDA for approval. The budget will be monitored through the unaudited quarterly  financial reports, which will measure the actual performance against the targets for each period, through the  integrated management tool for FM, GIAF accounting software, which is already functional and has been used to  prepare the latest annual accounts of EDM. Significant differences between the planned and actual expenditures  will also need to be documented in the quarterly reports, which will be submitted to IDA within 45 days after the  end of each calendar quarter. The principles and procedures for preparation of the consultative budget are already  included in the existing Implementation Manual, including its respective formats.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 45 of 84         \n 10.  Accounting arrangements. The accounting transactions will be recorded and summarized in the GIAF  accounting software for EDM, which will also be used to generate quarterly and annual reports. In addition to the  accounting system to be installed and the books needed to maintain an accurate and complete record of  transactions. EDM will need technical assistance to ensure just-in-time country-based support for GIAF to ensure  continuity in the case of interruption.  11.  EDM\u2019s finance department is headed by an experienced Director and accountants. EDM has been  implementing several World Bank-financed operations over the last decade. EDM has also appointed an  accountant who will be solely responsible for the activities of the project but will still work under the overall  responsibility of the Director. The Director\u2019s experience will play a key role in the transfer of know-how and  providing training to all accountants. FUNAE also has extensive experience in handling World Bank-financed  operations, including the ongoing PERIP and the recently closed EDAP.  12.  The project will make use of International Public Sector Accounting Standards and Cash Basis of  accounting, which recognizes transactions and events only when cash (including cash equivalents) are received or  paid by both the implementing agencies.  Internal Control Arrangements  13.  Internal control systems. The assessment was favorably affected by the fact that EDM and FUNAE have  been implementing World Bank-financed operations continuously for at least the past decade and they have  generally performed well. However, the review of the payment process indicates that there are significant delays  which could impact the timely implementation of activities. EDM and FUNAE will need to strengthen its payment  cycle to ensure that the process is clear and transparent. These procedures will be documented in the  Implementation Manual, which will be approved by the World Bank. A review of project audit reports and internal  systems and procedures did not reveal significant reportable issues. However, EDM continues to face challenges,  particularly with regard to pension provisions and differences between commercial and financial systems, which  are expected to be solved with the full implementation of the GIAF.  14.  Internal auditing. EDM and FUNAE have each internal audit department performing post-audit activities  on all the financial transactions of the entity, including an assessment of whether the budget utilization is in line  with the intended purposes. At least annually, the internal audit department would be involved in conducting  audits pertaining to this project and such reports will need to be shared with IDA. The internal audit function  reports directly to the Chairman and Board of Directors for independence in the case of EDM.  Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements  15.  Funds flow arrangements. EDM and FUNAE will open separate DAs for the project at the Banco de  Mo\u00e7ambique, in U.S. dollar. Details of the DA and the Authorized Signatories Letter, in the format defined in the  Disbursement Letter, should be submitted to the World Bank, soon after the Financing Agreement is signed, to  ensure that there are no delays in the first disbursement.  16.  The implementing entities will submit an initial withdrawal application to the World Bank based on a six- month forecast, as stated in the Disbursement Letter, but also based on agreed project work plans and budget.  The arrangement is relatively simple with centralized payments at DES allowing for more effective control of the  project funds for EDM.  17.  Disbursement arrangements. The implementing agencies will use report-based disbursement procedures  mainly through the Advance disbursement method. It may also use other methods of disbursement such as Direct  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 46 of 84         \n Payments, Special Commitments, and Reimbursements.

Financial reporting arrangements. EDM and FUNAE will prepare quarterly unaudited financial reports in  form and content satisfactory to the World Bank, which will be submitted to the World Bank within 45 days after  the end each calendar quarter to which they relate. To simplify arrangements, the format of the reports will be  similar to those used under the recently closed project. Details of the reporting requirements, including content,  format, as well as frequency will be defined in the Implementation Manual. These reports will include (a) DA  activity statement; (b) summary payments subject to the World Bank\u2019s prior review; (c) summary payments not  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 47 of 84         \n subject to prior review; (d) detailed use of funds by project components/activity; and (e) explanation of variances  and short-term forecasts of expenditures.  19.  Auditing arrangements. Annual audited financial statements with the respective Management Letter will  be submitted by EDM and FUNAE to the World Bank within six months of the end of the year being audited. The  audit reports will be publicly disclosed on the World Bank\u2019s external website and the audits will be conducted in  accordance with International Standards on Auditing. EDM\u2019s audits will include appropriate disclosure of the  project activities as follows:   \u2022  A statement of sources and uses of funds showing funds;  \u2022  A summary of expenditures analyzed by both component and category;  \u2022  The supporting notes in respect of significant accounting policies and accounting standards adopted  by management; and  \u2022  Summary listing of withdrawal applications by reference number, date, and amount.  Procurement  20.  Applicable procedures. Procurement for the proposed operation will be carried out in accordance with  the \u2018World Bank Procurement Regulations for Borrowers under IPF\u2019, dated July 1, 2016, revised August 2018, and  the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. Further, the \u2018Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud  and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants\u2019, dated October 15, 2006, and  revised in January 2011 and July 2016, will apply.  21.  Procurement strategy. A PPSD was developed during preparation to inform the applicable procurement  arrangements during implementation of the Project. Both implementing agencies prepared their respective PPSD.  The PPSD highlighted that the envisaged contracts are not complex and do not require the adoption of innovative  or complex approaches beyond the capacity available in the two implementing Agencies.   22.  Procurement arrangements. Activities to be procured under the project are generally not complex,  despite the existence of some activity of considerable high value, but within the available capacity management  of EDM and FUNAE, who will be supported by the World Bank office in Mozambique, as required. The proposed  procurement activities for the project will be managed independently by the main beneficiaries: EDM through the  DES and supported by the Supply and Logistics Directorate (DAL), and FUNAE through their UGEA (procurement  unit). EDM has generally a long-standing experience with the World Bank in the implementation of several World  Bank funded operations. Furthermore, EDM also has experience in the implementation and management of other  donor\u2019s projects. DES is also currently managing a World Bank funded project and the available expertise will be  instrumental for synergies into the implementation of the proposed project. FUNAE was involved in the  implementation of the EDAP and, thus, possess some experience with the World Bank procurement procedures.  23.  Procedures for selection of consultants. Quality and Cost-Based Selection will be the main method for  the selection of firms for Updating Technical Standards for Design and Construction of Electricity Distribution  Infrastructure; Design and Supervision of Works in northern provinces; Design and Supervision of Works in central  and southern provinces. Occasionally, consulting services may be procured through Selection based on  Consultants\u2019 Qualifications and Least-Cost Selection procedures, whenever its complexity justify the adoption of  such methods in accordance with the PPSD.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 48 of 84         \n 24.  Procedures for procurement of works. Works contracts will be procured generally through Open  Competitive Procedure, the Request for Bids (RFB), consistent with the Mozambique Procurement Regulation  (Decree 5/2016 of March 8, 2016) and limited to the local market, particularly for the Installation Services for  rehabilitation and expansion of networks and the installation of PV mini-grids. There are no envisaged contracts  requiring Open International competition as per the PPSD.  25.  Procedures for goods. Goods, including Supply of transformers; Supply of meters; Supply of cables and  Conductors; Supply of Poles, will be procured through Open International procedures, to ensure adequate  competition and value for money. IT Equipment, Office furniture, vehicles, software, among others, will be  procured generally through Request for Quotations. When the estimated amount exceeds US$100,000,  procurement may be done through an Open Competitive Procedure, the RFB, consistent with the Mozambique  Procurement Regulation (Decree 5/2016 of March 8, 2016) and limited to the local market.  26.  The Procurement Plan will be individualized by each of the two beneficiaries, EDM and FUNAE. Each  agency will manage its own activities, separately, according to project design and will manage them through the  World Bank\u2019s tracking system, Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP).  27.  Review by the World Bank of procurement decisions. Table 1.3 indicates the initial values for prior  Review by the World Bank. All activities estimated to cost below these amounts shall be treated as post review  and will be reviewed by the World Bank during the Implementation Support Mission under a post procurement  review exercise. Direct Contracting/Single Source Selection will be subject to prior review only for contracts  estimated to cost more than the amounts indicated in Table 1.3. The World Bank may, from time to time, review  the amounts, based on the performance of the implementing agencies.  Table 1.3. Prior Review Thresholds per Implementing Agency  Procurement Type  Prior Review (US$)  EDM  Prior Review (US$)  FUNAE  Works and Supply and Installation  5,000,000  5,000,000  Goods and non-consulting services  1,500,000  1,500,000  Consultants (Firms)  500,000  500,000  Individual consultants   200,000  200,000  28.  Assessment of National Procedures. The Mozambique Procurement Regulation, the Decree 5/2016 of  March 8, has been assessed as required under the World Bank\u2019s Procurement Framework. The assessment  indicated that the Country\u2019s Regulations are generally consistent with international best practice for the following  reasons: (a) there is adequate advertising in national media; (b) the procurement is generally open to eligible firms  from any country; (c) contracts documents have an appropriate allocation of responsibilities, risks, and liabilities;  (d) there is publication of contract award information in local newspapers of wide circulation; (e) the national  regulations do not preclude the World Bank from its rights to review procurement documentation and activities  under the financing; (f) there is an acceptable complaints mechanism; and (g) maintenance of records of the  procurement process.   29.  However, the RFBs/request for proposals document shall require that bidders/proposers submitting  bids/proposals present a signed acceptance at the time of bidding, to be incorporated in any resulting contracts,  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 49 of 84         \n confirming application of, and compliance with, the World Bank\u2019s Anti-Corruption Guidelines, including without  limitation the World Bank\u2019s right to sanction and the World Bank\u2019s inspection and audit rights.  30.  With the incorporation of the above provision, the Mozambique Procurement Regulation will be  acceptable to be used under those procurements not subject to the World Bank\u2019s Prior Review, as the thresholds  indicated in Table 1.3, or any updates indicated by the World Bank in the Procurement Plan.  Environmental and Social (including safeguards)  31.  The project is classified as Category B, as the potential environmental impacts are limited in scope and  localized. The investment program is composed of a large number of small-scale and dispersed interventions, that  comprise urban, peri-urban and rural areas of Mozambique. Given the nature, scale and scope of the  infrastructure investments planned, no significant environmental or social impacts are foreseen and no protected  areas for nature conservation, species or natural habitats of particular interest will be directly or indirectly  affected. The project will have positive environmental impacts. The electrification program will help displace the  use of kerosene for lighting by the connection of the household to electricity services. Access to electricity service  will also displace small diesel generators used by businesses.  There are no significant and/or irreversible adverse  environmental issues anticipated from the investment for electrification under Component A to be financed under  the project. Civil works will lead to relatively minor air and water pollution during the construction phases and,  once the works are completed, limited loss of non-critical animal and plant habitats. Component B (off-grid  electrification using renewable energy) will have low to moderate negative impacts on the environment,  depending on their locations. The major environmental and public health risks might arise from improper disposal  of SHS batteries to be handled by private companies. Component C will finance technical assistance and capacity  building activities to better support the project implementation.   32.  The objective of most investments considered under the project is to increase access to electricity in  Mozambique. The scope or work consist of installation or construction of short LV extensions, limited MV  extensions, and some additional networks. This scope of work may require site and land clearance for right-of- way that could lead to loss of vegetation and associated fauna, soil disturbance and erosion, increased runoff and  sedimentation of water bodies, people\u2019s temporary or permanent physical displacement (Sub-component B will  require land acquisition for mini-grid in relation to the generation facilities), including issues of community and  worker\u2019s health and safety. Potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the project are expected to be  moderate, reversible and temporary.   33.  The following safeguard policies are triggered: (OP/BP 4.01) on Environmental Assessment, (OP/BP 4.04)  on Natural Habitats, (OP/BP 4.11) on Physical Cultural Resources, and (OP/BP 4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement.  OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats was triggered, because the project may include civil works with potential negative  impacts on natural habitats (coil, water, mainly), demanding specific provision on natural habitats, included in the  proposed ESMF. Although the project will not be involved in major civil works of large movements of earth in  areas containing sites deemed physical cultural resources, to ensure due diligence, chance find procedures are  included in the ESMF to address OP/BP 4.11 basic requirements. The project will not support activities in areas  with known physical cultural resources. No civil works within a river that is classified as an International Waterway  (under OP7.50, International Waterways) or a tributary to such a river will be eligible for funding.  34.  An ESMF and RFP have been prepared by the implementing agencies to guide the process in addressing  any negative social impact from the project. The documents set forth mechanisms for screening, supervision and  monitoring during implementation, including clear roles and responsibilities of client contractors and supervisors  including a proposal of institutional strengthening program for EDM and FUNAE. The ESMF comprises a generic  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 50 of 84         \n ESMP and subset of guidelines and code of conduct for implementers. RPF will guide how project impacts will be  mitigated and will guide the preparation of site-specific RAPs or Abbreviated RAPs, in case the project identifies  project affected people that need to be resettled or compensated. Given the nature of works related to activities  under PERIP, some of the RPF provisions will follow the provisions approved by the PERIP RPF. Under Component  C the project will also consider capacity building for EDM/FUNAE personnel for better monitoring of safeguards  aspects of the project.  35.  The Borrower\u2019s institutional capacity for safeguards management has increased during past years. EDM  has recently executed two World Bank financed projects (EDAP and PERIP), gaining experience on World Bank  safeguards policies. The ESMF and RFP included the environmental and social management roles and  responsibilities of the contractors and the supervision engineers, as well as a proposal of institutional  strengthening program considering ongoing and proposed activities by EDM and FUNAE that could potentially  stretch out its safeguards capacity and staffing.  36.  The ESMF has been consulted upon, approved by the World Bank, and disclosed in the World Bank website  and in-country on January 25, 2019. The RPF has been consulted upon, approved by the World Bank, and disclosed  in the World Bank website on January 17, 2019 and in-country on January 23, 2019.  Monitoring and Evaluation  37.  The M&E of the project will be carried out by the EDM and FUNAE implementing units for their respective  components. Both PIUs will prepare quarterly reports to be discussed at Senior Management level and periodically  with the institutions\u2019 Board. The quarterly progress reports will be submitted to MIREME and the World Bank.  These reports will include results indicators, as well as reporting on the implementation of the ESMP, RAP, Health  and Safety Plans.   38.  The World Bank team will then prepare periodic progress reports, mid-term report and completion report  which will be shared with the DPs co-financing the project through the MDTF.   39.  The proposed project contemplates the procurement of supervision consultants who will support the  implementing agencies in preparing progress reports and evaluating the progress of the works implemented by  the Contractors.  Role of Partners  40.  The project will be co-financed by the Governments of Norway and Sweden and EC and resources will be  channeled through the MDTF to be administrated by the World Bank. This will facilitate the implementation of  the electrification program with single procedures in terms of fiduciary, reporting and monitoring arrangements  and will ensure that resources fully support the principles of the NES established by the GoM. The World Bank will  report annually to the contributing members of the MDTF and hold an annual meeting with contributing and  recipient members to ensure timely feedback and correction measures, as required. Regular feedback will be  provided to contributing countries as part of the regular World Bank supervision. The World Bank will notify  contributing members about formal supervision announcements and meetings that will take place at least every  six months and aide-memoires will be circulated. As per invitation of EDM, contributing members will also carry  out joint meetings and site visits minimum once per year.   \n   The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 51 of 84         \n Strategy and Approach for Implementation Support  41.  The strategy for implementation support was developed based on the nature of the project and its risk  profile. Its aim is to make implementation support to the client more flexible, efficient, and focused on the risk  mitigation measures defined in the project risk summary.  42.  The World Bank will provide implementation support to the client office through Headquarter and  Maputo-based staff to ensure timely, efficient and effective implementation support. Formal implementation  support mission will be carried out twice a year.  43.  Technical Inputs. For both on-grid and off-grid components, the client will engage contractors to execute  physical works. Effective preparation of bidding documents and work supervision requires sound technical  knowledge. Therefore, the PIU will engage supervision consultants to strengthen their implementation capacity  through Component C. The World Bank will also support capacity building for the client to carry out geospatial  analysis.  44.  Fiduciary requirements. Maputo-based World Bank staff will support the PIU to ensure that fiduciary  requirements, including FM, procurement and environmental/social safeguard requirements are met.  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 52 of 84         \n   Table 1.4.

The GoM has prepared the NES defining the institutional, technical and financial arrangements aimed at  achieving universal access by accelerating the connection of new users and the sustainable provision of good  quality electricity service. Implementation of the NES implies adoption of multiple modalities for electrification,  including densification of already electrified areas to reach all existing households, businesses and public facilities,  expansion of the national grid to all areas where this is economically feasible, and provision of off-grid electricity  services through mini-grids and standalone SHS in all other zones. The project will support the implementation of  the first phase of the NES, by financing the construction of on-grid and off-grid infrastructure needed to provide  electricity services to new users, and technical assistance needed for that purpose and to ensure sustainable  provision of electricity service.  Component A: Peri-urban and Rural Electrification (estimated cost US$126 million equivalent: IDA Grant-US$60  million, Multi-Donor Trust Fund \u2013 US$66 million)  2.  Rationale. The national transmission system of Mozambique is composed of two separate (not  interconnected) networks built in the southern and northern regions of the country. The network reaches all 154  districts in the country with the existing distribution networks. However, a significant number of structures  (households, businesses, etc.) are still not connected. This creates an opportunity to use available capacity of  existing infrastructure to build additional distribution networks and service connections to incorporate and supply  new users. Available capacity and good condition of existing infrastructure is ensured through execution of  rehabilitation and upgrade investments in the scope of the ongoing Short-Investment Program financed by  bilateral DPs and the World Bank under the PERIP.    3.  Scope. Through the geospatial plan, GoM and EDM have identified over 500 settlements in 20  predominantly rural and peri-urban districts across the country located relatively close to existing electricity  networks, which can be fully electrified through a combination of densification and short-range grid extension.  This component will finance the design, supply of equipment and materials and construction works required to  connect all households and businesses in those settlements through densification and short-range grid extension.  The settlements have been grouped in geographic areas/zones to facilitate procurement, logistics and other  project implementation arrangements. Of the 20 target districts, six are located in the North Region, five in the  Central Region, and three zones in each of South Region, Maputo City and Maputo Province. The project will  finance all activities (design, supply and construction) needed to connect around 250,000 households, of which  about 185,000 (74 percent) are in rural areas and 65,000 are in peri-urban areas. The overall number of electrified  households in rural areas will almost double from the current estimate of 240,000 to 437,600 (82 percent  increase). All public facilities and businesses located in the settlements will also be connected.    4.  Estimated amounts of physical works. EDM has estimated that the following works will be needed to  connect about 250,000 new customers in project target areas: construction of about 1,500 km of MV lines,  installation of 1,200 distribution transformers, extension of 3,500 km of low voltage distribution lines and  installation of about 11,000 km in service drops (users\u2019 connections). Ready boards will be installed in low-income  households unable to pay for the internal wiring.    \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 55 of 84         \n 5.  Implementation arrangements. Based on the lessons learned during the implementation of similar  projects financed by the World Bank, specific procurement and supervision arrangements aimed at optimizing  unit construction costs (US$/new user connected) are included in the design of the component. Regarding the  procurement aspects, EDM will conduct separate processes for procurement of design, supply of main equipment  and materials, and installation works, rather than through a turnkey (EPC) approach. This is the typical  arrangement adopted by capable distribution companies for the construction of medium and low voltage  networks and connection of low voltage customers. The proposed approach can result in intense competition for  supply in bulk of the main equipment and materials (poles, conductors, transformers and meters), resulting in  lower prices. The arrangement creates favorable conditions for the participation of local companies in execution  of construction works. EDM is in the final stages of selecting consultants to prepare detailed design of the  electrification projects. EDM will also be supported by external consultants in the supervision of construction  works. Preliminary estimates made by EDM show that expected average cost per connection is approximately  US$505 for urban and peri-urban areas.  6.  Design and construction of distribution networks for urban, peri-urban and rural areas will be  standardized to help cost optimization. With support from specialized consultants, EDM will define optimized  standards for design and construction of medium (operating voltage of between 1 kV and 33 kV) and for low  voltage distribution infrastructure to be built in the future in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, including the  incorporation of low-cost technologies successfully adopted for massive rural electrification in the United States,  Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Peru and Tunisia (among other countries). Establishment of optimized standards  will make it possible to minimize unit investment costs for connecting new users and supplying them in full  compliance with applicable standards on service quality. The design of distribution networks will follow the same  technical standards for on-grid and off-grid assets to ensure proper interconnection capability between the two  systems by the time the national grid reaches the off-grid areas.   7.  Project design eliminates barriers for connection of new users. At present the minimum upfront  connection charge paid by new electricity users in Mozambique is MZN 3,500 (approximately US$60). This charge  varies depending on distance of household to the existing grid and customer category (social, domestic, industrial,  etc.). Evidence shows that existing connection charges are unaffordable to a substantial part of the Mozambican  population, even to those living inside EDM\u2019s existing grid footprint. This includes most FHHs. As the scope of the  component includes all activities needed to connect at the same time all households in each selected settlement,  there is no need for EDM to collect any upfront connection charge from new users. Therefore, the design of the  component removes the main demand-side barrier to electrification and shows the commitment of GoM to  implement the electrification program and move towards gender equality. EDM will recover OPEX to serve all its  customers through Allowed Tariff Revenues set by the competent authority.  8.  Logistics arrangements for equipment and materials and construction works. EDM has defined the  logistics for supply of material and equipment and implementation of construction works on the PPSD, which  included: (a) testing at manufacturers\u2019 facilities; (b) reception in special-purpose warehouses (within the premises  of existing warehouses but physically separated from others) whose location is defined according to the  areas/zones where electrification projects will be executed; (c) separate management of the new virtual  warehouses through the GIAF-ERP system; and (d) delivery to construction contractors as needed according to  the respective construction schedules.   9.  Registration of new users as EDM\u2019s customers. With the rapid increase in number of EDM\u2019s customers,  the utility must review and optimize procedures to register new consumers connected through the electrification  projects as regular customers and manage them regularly with the support of the CMS and its GIS-based  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 56 of 84         \n customers\u2019 database. This activity is supported by PERIP but will be further monitored through this project. EDM  will also strengthen its customer profiling, for example by tagging male and FHHs.  10.  Connection of public facilities. The project will connect public facilities in the project area based on the  information provided by the national departments of health and education.   Component B: Off-grid Electrification (estimated cost US$13 million equivalent from IDA)   Sub-component B.1 \u2013 Mini-grid electrification estimated cost US$10 million equivalent from IDA)  11.  This activity will support the electrification of areas where electricity supply through mini-grids represents  the least-cost option from a country\u2019s perspective. The locations of mini-grids will be informed by the results of  the Mozambique Geospatial Options Analysis towards Universal Electrification (funded by ESMAP) which includes  the initial site identification made by FUNAE. FUNAE has identified 13 potential mini-grid sites across several  districts in the north of Mozambique to be supplied through combined solar PV and battery storage with a total  estimated capacity of 2.6 MWp and with the potential to reach 7,000 consumers. The proposed project will finance  the construction of approximately six of this mini-grids, adding approximately 4,000 new customers. In the  settlements to be electrified by the mini-grid, the proposed project will connect all potential customers in selected  sites, ensuring economies of scale.  12.  Mini-grids will be developed under a PPP whereby IPPs will invest, operate, and maintain solar generation  facilities of each mini-grid under PPAs with EDM; and the distribution network and service connections will be  public investments financed by the project and operated by EDM. This arrangement will enhance private  participation in rural electrification. FUNAE will contract the design and construction of distribution network  components of the mini-grid and supervise implementation activities. The infrastructure built by FUNAE will be  transferred to EDM for service delivery and O&M.31 Therefore, the new beneficiaries of mini-grids will become  EDM\u2019s consumers and face the national uniform tariff.    13.  The mini-grids will be implemented in a phased approach. The first phase will consist of approximately 6  sites, selected using defined criteria established in the NES and in collaboration with private investors. In these  sites the PPP concept will be tested. If the approach proves successful, the remaining sites will be implemented in  a similar manner. In order to increase the attractiveness of small solar IPPs, the project could partner with IFC in  supporting EDM in the competitive procurement and implementation under IPP arrangements of a portfolio of  on-grid and mini-grid systems.  14.  Affordability. As the potential beneficiaries will be EDM customers, mini-grid customers will pay the same  tariff for each category charged to users connected to the national grid, ensuring effective implementation of a  national uniform tariff policy. Recurrent charges to be paid by EDM to the IPPs and O&M contractor in every mini- grid under the PPA and distribution O&M contract will be passed-through to allowed tariff revenues of EDM set  by the competent authority. This will allow the socialization of the operating costs incurred by the utility to serve  consumers connected to mini-grids among all customers countrywide.  15.  Sustainability. Construction and O&M contracts, both for generation and network assets of the mini-grids,  will be procured on a competitive basis to ensure long-term service provision of electricity services by EDM to  consumers, in full compliance with applicable standards.   16.  Site identification. Locations will be confirmed by GoM, based on the results of the Mozambique  Geospatial Options Analysis, which incorporates all the sites identified by FUNAE in the Renewable Energy Projects                                               31 In order to ensure that the quality of service meets applicable standards, EDM may outsource the O&M of network assets, and retail  services to qualified private contractors through an O&M contract.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 57 of 84         \n Portfolio32 and the pre-feasibility studies that have been carried out.  There will be a mix of more densely  populated sites and less densely populated sites in each lot, where possible, to enhance their overall commercial  attractiveness.    17.  Enhance private participation in generation to accelerate rural electrification. The project will also  explore the possibility to partner with IFC in supporting EDM in the competitive procurement and implementation  under IPP arrangements of a portfolio of medium- and small-scale grid connected solar PV plants. IFC is currently  supporting EDM in the identification of 3-5 sites in the more remote areas of the radial grid (Central / Northern  region), with easy connection to the grid, where 10 - 25MW (up to 50MW in aggregate) solar PV plants included  in least-cost planning could be built and run by IPPs. Battery storage might be added to mitigate the intermittent  nature of solar PV generation and/or to allow for load-shifting and dispatch of the plants after sunset. IFC and  World Bank agreed on packaging the sites for medium scale grid-connected solar PV projects with a set of sites  where small-scale solar PV plants for supply to mini-grids will be built also under the IPP scheme. This would allow  EDM to get the benefits of economies of scale deriving from procurement and implementation of a portfolio of  projects involving larger installed capacity. In case IPP arrangements for solar PV plants for mini-grids do not  materialize\u2014due to the security risks in some of the target provinces or other reasons\u2014a fully public model for  electrification will be considered, with both generation facilities and distribution network (including service drops)  are fully financed by the project.   18.  Feasibility and packaging. This component will be complemented by preparatory studies to (a) confirm  the sites through further feasibility studies and techno-economic analysis; (b) promote productive and efficient  use of energy by users; and (c) provide technical, legal, and procurement support to effectively design the bidding  documents and supervise the construction of the mini-grid assets.   19.  The following activities will be carried out by the different stakeholders:   FUNAE  a. Select sites in coordination with MIREME and EDM.  b. Carry out the detailed engineering design of the mini-grid (demand assessment, sizing of solar power plan  and storage, design of the distribution network, etc.).  c. Ensure availability of land required for the generation module of the mini-grid system and facilitate the  environmental permits.  d. Package a set of mini-grids to increase the size of contracts and attract experienced contractors.  e. In coordination with EDM, prepare bidding documents to award contracts for construction, O&M of mini- grid facilities (PPAs and network O&M).    EDM   a. Sign the PPAs and network O&M service contract   ARENE / MIREME   a. Allow pass-through to allowed revenue requirement of costs incurred by EDM under PPAs and network O&M.  b. Issue licenses for mini-grid IPPs and (if necessary) the operations and maintenance services contractors.   Subcomponent B.2: Off-grid results-based-financing facility (RBF) estimated cost US$3 million equivalent from                                               32 FUNAE (2017) \u2013 Renewable Energy Projects Portfolio for Hydro and Solar Resources.  \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 58 of 84         \n IDA)  \n 20.  This sub-component will support the expansion of off-grid energy market in Mozambique through a RBF  Facility. The RBF will offer clear and predictable financial incentives to distributors for the sale of high-quality (that  is, Lighting Global quality-verified) products on a first-come, first-served basis. The RBF is helping cover expansion  costs, including finding and training new agents, improving supply chains, and acquiring new customers (for  example, through marketing and consumer engagement campaigns). Existing RBF schemes have typically taken a  one-size-fits-all approach to off-grid solar sales, simply using a formula to calculate incentive payments based on  the access provided by each system sold. The RBF will disburse based on verified results (for example, market  entry, sales) by an independent verification agent, through a Fund Manager, both contracted by FUNAE. Such a  facility can offer financial remuneration for quality verified products creating credibility of such solar products,  creating a space for new entrants, as well as supporting deeper penetration to bottom of the pyramid consumer  segments. The facility will complement the ongoing efforts by DPs to scale-up the off-grid market with working  capital and grant facilities and addressing other barriers and equip FUNAE with an instrument to support off-grid  electrification under the framework of the GoM \u201cPrograma Nacional de Energia para todos\u201d. This facility will  encompass three main attributes.  21.  Quality. The Facility will primarily support quality-certified SHSs and potentially other energy technologies  such as solar water pumps for agriculture and efficient cooking solutions. Given the market spoilage by low-quality  solar products in Mozambique, the Facility will support Lighting Global quality-verified products. For water pumps  and clean cooking solutions, appropriate third-party certification of product quality will be included in the  eligibility criteria to receive the project support. In addition, provision of adequate after-sales service, such as  warrantee or customer support, will be required.  22.  Geographical targeting. These RBF payments will help these companies to expand faster and serve more  remote and poorer clients that otherwise could not be served. The RBF scheme will therefore have a strong pro- poor impact. Such geographical targeting will help direct the companies into areas where distribution channels  are more difficult to establish, and affordability concerns are more pronounced.  23.  Increasing market players. The RBF payments will be structured to support not only the existing players,  but also entry for new domestic and international players. This will allow a more dynamic market condition and  healthy competition. For this purpose, RBF could pay for initial set-up, consumer awareness, training of sales  agents etc.   24.  FUNAE will retain consultancy services to manage the RBF since this is the first such opportunity. The RBF  will be managed by an Independent Fund Manager with high standards of transparency and integrity. After the  project closing, the Facility may continue to operate under FUNAE.  25.  Collaboration with existing programs. The facility will complement the ongoing efforts by DPs to  incentivize the off-grid market with working capital facilities and addressing other barriers and equip FUNAE with  an instrument to support off-grid electrification, particularly with the program from KfW Sustainable Economic  Development Project. The KfW Sustainable Economic Development Project provides credit lines at interest rates  lower than market rates to enterprises and individuals providing renewable energy or energy efficiency solutions.  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 59 of 84         \n Component C: Technical Assistance and Implementation Support (estimated cost US$9 million equivalent from  IDA)   Sub-component 1: Technical Assistance to EDM (US$6 million).   26.  Capacity building and implementation support for EDM, for project management expenses such as the  financing of external audit, oversight of implementation of the environmental and safeguards instruments for the  investments, oversight of the health and safety aspects during construction, enhancement of procurement  procedures and material logistics, related studies for electrification, short term consultants and training. (estimate  US$3 million).  27.  Community Engagement Program. EDM has an ongoing community outreach program, with components  of awareness campaigns, community education and customer communication, using various communication  platforms such as radio in various national languages, video, theater, house-to-house, etc. EDM\u2019s Community  Engagement Program (\u201cbe connected, be safe, be efficient\u201d) mainstreams gender-sensitive information as well as  supports the empowerment of vulnerable groups in the communities (women, young, children, etc.). The project  will support the community outreach program of EDM, (a) through a new connection campaign (\"be connected\"),  to inform people in target areas (on-grid and off-grid) the cost of electricity services, uniformed payment for  electricity connection to be paid in installments without any up-front payment, procedures and safety practices  of the electrification process lead by the commercial department who are responsible for marketing with the dual  objective to reduce illegal connections, and (b) to provide information to the communities about safety aspects  of electricity (\"be safe\"), raise awareness on the negative impacts of energy theft and vandalism of the  infrastructure, and the benefits of adopting energy efficiency and conservation practices (\"be efficient\"). (estimate  US$0.5 million).  28.  Young Professionals Program at EDM aims to build a new generation workforce, with professional  experience and enhanced leadership skills. The project will support EDM\u2019s efforts to bring future talent to be  trained through the project and after a time frame of three-five years to be transferred to EDM core business  areas. The project will support the new young professional program and the overall program coordination. Half  of the selected professionals will support directly the implementation of the electrification program. They will  receive hands-on training, specialized short-term training, exposure to all the elements of the process leading to  new connections from the planning, procurement, safeguards, commercial aspects, incorporation of new  customers to the management information system and customer service. The selection process will be done by  EDM's HR directorate in coordination with the relevant departments hosting the professionals, and performance  evaluation will be regular. At least 30 percent of the selected professionals will be women, which contributes  towards closing gender gaps at the institutional level given that only 25 percent of women at EDM work in  technical roles. The professionals will report directly to the hosting departments. (estimate US$1 million).  29.  Gender mainstreaming in EDM to support the following set of activities: (a) establishing a program to  train young women in technical areas, to later be hired by EDM (scholarship program); (b) develop a policy for  gender equality and justice in EDM (regulations to complement the Code of Ethics); (c) implementation of a  Gender Equality Seal, as a ranking and incentive system to promote the adoption of gender principles and  regulations, and link it to the performance evaluation of organizational units; (d) developing audio-visual material  for awareness and basic training on gender equality and gender justice for EDM staff. The project will support part  of the implementation of the strategy in coordination with other DPs.

Project management-related expenses such as the financing of  external audit, oversight of implementation of the environmental and safeguards instruments for the investments,  as well as the oversight of health and safety aspects during construction and operation. In addition, FUNAE, with  support from contracted consultants, will develop a business strategy aligned with the roles it has been assigned  under the recently approved NES and the development of Global Lighting quality standards for SHSs. (estimate  US$1.0 million)  31.  Independent verification agent and consultant for RBF facility. This activity will support consultancy  services related to the creation and implementation of a facility manager as well as the procurement of an  independent verification agency for the RBF facility. (estimated US$1.0 million)  32.  Capacity building. This activity will support training for FUNAE staff to acquire adequate technical,  planning, and operational capacity to implement the off-grid electrification activities and effectively undertake  activities under Component B. (estimated US$1.0 million).  Project Cost and Financing  33.  The project will be a regular IPF with a duration of five years. It will be funded through an IDA grant with  joint co-financing for Component A in the form of a grant from a new MDTF that has been established. Table 2.1  is indicative and all payments for Component A will be shared between the IDA grant and the MDTF.   34.  It is expected that grant resources, in an indicative total amount of US$66 million for the recipient- executed portion, will be secured and be available for joint co-financing. The grant agreement will be signed based  on the contribution received into the MDTF. Additional grant resources will then be passed on to the Government  as and when they are received without the need to process a restructuring or additional financing. In case the co- financing does not materialize or is less than expected, either additional resources will be sought potentially  through an IDA additional financing mechanism or the project will be restructured to be proportionately scaled  down.  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 61 of 84         \n Table 2.1.

The ProEnergia project aims to increase access to electricity services for about 272,000 new customers in  targeted areas of Mozambique (250,000 through grid densification, 4,000 through mini-grids and 18,000 by  incentivizing the SHS market). Economic analysis has been undertaken to assess the economic viability of the  project. The analysis is based on standard cost-benefit analysis for investment components, namely grid extension  (Component A) and off-grid solution (Component B). The technical assistance component (Component C) is not  included in the analysis due to the methodological challenges in quantifying the cost and benefit. In addition,  affordability analysis has been carried out to determine whether the electricity service is affordable to the poor  segment of Mozambican population.  2.  Project Costs. The on-grid component will finance grid extension investments as well as a connection  subsidy scheme to remove the barrier of connection fees. The investment will include construction and/or  extension of medium- and low-voltage lines (including line drops) and installation of ready-boards for households  which cannot afford internal wiring of the premises. EDM estimated the average connection cost in selected  townships will be US$505 per customer, assuming that EDM will prioritize the sites to achieve lowest cost per  connection within the project budget. The cost items considered also include O&M cost as well as the cost of  electricity services (see Table 3.2). Taxes and duties are excluded from the analysis.   3.  For mini-grid investment (Component B1), based on the figures provided by the FUNAE, an average cost  of a mini-grid system is estimated to be US$0.88 million and is expected to connect approximately 431 households  and 117 commercial and institutional users. The project will pilot a public-private partnership in which the  generation component is financed by the private sector, while the GoM (through FUNAE) provides the finance to  support CAPEX expenditures in network and other activities33. For SHS investment through RBF (component B2),  an average cost of US$110 per basic Tier 2 system (capable or powering three lamps, phone charger and radio)  has been assumed.  4.  Project benefits. The project benefit arises from the economic utility of electricity usage by newly  connected users. Therefore, the Willingness to Pay (WTP) for electricity services has been estimated based on  their energy expenditure. According to the SE4ALL framework, energy is affordable if it falls into 5 percent of their  household expenditure. Therefore, 5 percent of current household expenditure is used as a conservative estimate  of a WTP.  5.  The users are disaggregated into low-income, middle-income and high-income users, using the  classification in the NES. They represent poorest quantile, third poorest quantile and richest quantile of population  respectively. Since a large share of the connections / SHS sold are expected to be in the five poorest provinces, 64  percent of the total new customers (including grid, mini-grids and SHS) were assumed to be in low-income; 13                                               33 For the purposes of the economic analysis, the total CAPEX (excluding taxes and import duties) for mini-grid is considered, irrespective  of which entity (public or private) provides the financial resources.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 63 of 84         \n percent will be either high-income or commercial/institutional users; and the rest is assumed to be middle- income. The summary of the customer disaggregation is provided in Table 3.1.  Table 3.1. Summary of Customer Disaggregation and WTP  \n Proportion (%)  WTP  Consumption   Low- income  64  US$2.0/month  180 kWh/year  Middle-Income  23  US$4.7/month  540 kWh/year  High -Income, commercial and institutional users  13  US$0.3/kWh  2400 kWh/year  Note: It is assumed that WTP for low- and middle- income population increases by 2.6 percent and 4.8 percent per year, respectively. It is  assumed that WTP and consumption level of commercial and institutional customers are equivalent to high-income residential customer  that are already using diesel genset that will be replaced by access to grid/mini-grid services. The consumption figures are extracted from  the preparatory studies for the NES.  Other Assumptions  6.  The discount rate has been determined based on the World Bank\u2019s internal guidance which recommends  using twice of the prospect real per capita GDP growth as a proxy of the discount rate. Mozambique\u2019s Growth  forecast between 2018 and 2020 averages about 3.45 percent according to the latest macroeconomic  projection34. On this basis, the discount rate of 7 percent is employed. The assumptions employed in the analysis  are summarized below.  7.  The emission reduction of the project has been estimated using emission factors based on World Bank\u2019s  GHG guidance and other reputable sources.

Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to test the robustness of the economic viability of the project.  The analysis found that the project will be economically viable as long as the CAPEX (both for grid and mini-grid  investments) increase does not exceed 187 percent of the initial estimation. Similarly, the project will remain  economically as long as the overall WTP of all beneficiaries does not decrease more than 20 percent across the  entire lifetime of the project.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy for All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)                                                         \n   \n   \n Page 65 of 84         \n   Affordability Analysis of Electricity Service  10.  Given the importance of the project\u2019s benefits channeled to the poor segment of Mozambican population,  affordability of electricity services has been assessed. A common definition of affordability is a household\u2019s  monthly expenditure on electricity not exceeding 5 percent of total household expenditures in order to purchase  30kWh per month, which is a subsistence level electricity consumption.35. This definition of affordability is  employed in this analysis.   11.  In Mozambique, HH at the lowest income quantile (20 percent) has monthly expenditure of MT 2,344.36  Therefore, with the above definition of affordability, Mt 117.2 is the approximate threshold for electricity to be  affordable. With the latest 2018 retail tariff of electricity by EDM, 30kWh falls under the social tariff category  which is Mt 1.07/kWh. Therefore, 30kWh of electricity will cost MT 32.1 per month. This constitutes 1.3 percent  of a household\u2019s energy expenditure, well below the 5 percent threshold. This tariff is the same for both grid  connection and mini-grid connection under the GoM\u2019s universal tariff policy. Therefore, the electricity service is  considered affordable to the poor segments of Mozambican population.  12.  To take into account geographical disparities, the affordability analysis has been repeated at the provincial  levels. Table 3.4 illustrates affordability ceilings for subsistence energy expenditure in each province of  Mozambique, in comparison with the estimated electricity expenditure. It validates that, in all provinces in  Mozambique, expected electricity expenditure is well below their affordability threshold of 5 percent.  Table 3.4.

Poverty analysis has been carried out to analyze the extent to which the project reaches out to the poor  beneficiaries in Mozambique, ensuring the project\u2019s contribution to the WBG\u2019s twin goals of poverty reduction  and shared prosperity. Although the poverty level in the country is in decline, in 2015, nearly half - 48.4 percent -  of the Mozambican people lived under poverty.37 There is also a significant variation in poverty level across the  country. In general, the poverty level is higher in northern regions, such as Niassa, Nampula and Zambezia. The  poverty level is significantly lower in southern parts of the country, notably in the capital of Maputo city and the  surrounding Maputo Provinces. The geographical variation is presented in Table 3.5 as well as the map at the end  of the document.  14.  It is expected that nearly 50 percent of new connections are made in the five poorest provinces of  Mozambique \u2013 Niassa, Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado and Sofala. More than 85,000 connections are expected  to be made in Nampula.  Table 3.5.

On-grid and mini-grid technologies will play different roles in these poorest provinces. Mini-grid will likely  reach small number (approximately 4,000 households) of rural and poorest segments of the population, whereas  the on-grid connection will reach large number (approximately 250,000 households) of beneficiaries in rural towns  and their surroundings.                                               37 World Bank (2018) Mozambique Poverty Assessment.  153,180  169,112  Geographical distribution of new electircity  connections Poorest 5 provinces Other provinces \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 67 of 84         \n   Table 3.6.

A historical financial analysis was carried out for EDM\u2019s financial statements and key performance  indicators for the period 2012 - 2017, in a difficult macroeconomic environment where the Mozambican Metical  (MT) versus the US$ dropped by nearly 50 percent to 0.17 between December 2012 and December 2017 while  the accumulated inflation was over 45 percent in the same period.  17.  Some key productivity indicators are presented in Table 3.7.  Table 3.7. Key Productivity Indicators  \n 18.  Since 2014, Mozambique\u2019s generation capacity has expanded to 2,724 MW to serve local and regional  demand, with significant participation from the private sector through PPP. In February 2015, a 175 MW gas fired  IPP was commissioned at CTRG, a joint-venture between EDM (51 percent) and Sasol (49 percent). In December  2015, a 120 MW Gigawatt IPP was also commissioned at Ressano Garcia. In October 2017, a 40 MW gas fired IPP  (Kuvaninga) was commissioned in Chokwe. All three IPPs have signed PPAs with EDM. The entry into operation of  these plants transformed EDM\u2019s energy balance, modifying significantly the unit cost of generation.   19.  In 2017, EDM produced a total of 6,505.6GWh, declining by 8 percent compared to 2016 output: this is  primarily due to a drop in HCB hydroelectric purchase, as during the previous year the Cahora dam was not able  to operate at full capacity due to low levels of water in the reservoir. In December 2016, the elevation of the  reservoir had fallen to 312 meters above sea level, the lowest recorded since the construction of the dam. There  was a significant recovery in 2017 and by the end of the year the elevation had reached almost 318 meters:  however, this level is still way below the elevation of 326 meters regarded as necessary for normal operations.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 69 of 84         \n   \n Table 3.8. EDM Energy Balance Trend  \n Figure 3.2. EDM Energy Matrix  \n Source: World Bank (2018).  20.  The shift in the generation mix towards thermal generation and the fact that the energy acquisition prices  are determined on hard currency, as per the PPA, exacerbated the negative impact on EDM\u2019s cost structure during  the rapid devaluation of the MT versus the U S dollar across the period analyzed. In 2016, the average unit energy  fuel and purchase cost reached US$c6.36/kWh, with a slight decline compared to 2016, but still standing on high  levels, due to a lower contribution from hydropower output than in the past years (53 percent on total energy  supplied in 2017 compared to around 90 percent during 2012 - 2014).  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 70 of 84         \n   Figure 3.3. Total Electricity Supplied and Average Unit Cost for Energy Purchases  \n Source: World Bank (2018)  21.  The still high levels in energy purchase costs in 2017 \u2013 although 7 percent lower than 2016 levels \u2013 were  only partially offset by an increase of over 100 percent in the Average Tariff (including Exports) that occurred in  the same period. However, since 2012 the tariff increase observed during the period (+17 percent as average  yearly compound growth) has not been not enough to compensate the increase of fuel and energy purchase cost  (+37 percent on an average yearly basis) and the impact of inflation and MT depreciation.   22.  The following graphs illustrate the evolution during 2012 - 2017 of the average tariff, without export, [in  MT/kWh], of the average domestic tariff [in MT/kWh] and fuel and IPP unit cost.

As a consequence of the sharper increase across the period analyzed in fuel and energy purchase average  costs as compared to the pace of tariff growth, EDM financial sustainability was significantly impacted. EBITDA  showed a sharp decrease during the period 2011 \u2013 2016, mainly driven by tariff increases (no tariff increases  occurred during 2011-2014) that were not sufficient to cover the increase in the energy purchase costs and fixed  costs, highlighting that in 2015 and 2016 the tariff increase was not even enough to fully pass-through the increase  in the energy purchasing costs. In 2017, EBITDA turned negative, highlighting EDM\u2019s difficulties in controlling its  cost structure evolution. Since 2012, electricity revenues [in MT] almost tripled to over MT27 million whilst the  variable supply costs grew nearly seven times, which reflects a disproportional trend to expected revenue/variable  cost ratio. This trend is also reflected in a lower 2016 and 2017 Gross Profit than 2014 and, consequently, in highly  negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), on the back of the growing fixed cost structure.  Table 3.9. EDM Income Statement (2012-2017)  \n 24.  This has put at risk the company\u2019s financial sustainability, whose free cash flow production has worsened  across the period examined.

On the other hand, negative account payables and positive receivables for 2017 fiscal year helped  maintaining EDM\u2019s OCF on the positive side.  Table 3.10. EDM Cash Flow Statement (2012-2017)  \n 25.  During the full period under analysis, the OCF was highly insufficient to cover the CAPEX, showing a gap  between financial needs for the company due to higher investments and internal self-financing capabilities, that  has been growing every year. Despite an increasingly negative EBITDA during the past four years, the CAPEX  increased significantly. This is reflected in a growing negative free cash flow during the period, which was financed  by an increase in loans and donations. In particular, in 2017 the EDM financial situation, which was deeply under  distress, required a MT7 billion equity injection. As a consequence, the balance sheet shows an important increase  in fixed assets \u2013 that in 2017 more than doubled compared to 2012 levels \u2013 and accounts receivables (MT7 billion  in 2017 compared to MT0.4 billion in 2012), which have been financed by Loans from Multilateral Development  Banks, Donation and Grants and accounts payable.  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 73 of 84         \n   Table 3.11.

Debt, fueled by the need to keep up with the investment plan for generation, transmission and  distribution activities, grew significantly during the period, finishing by the end of 2017 with a Debt/Equity ratio  of 4.21x, compared with a maximum typically accepted range in the industry of between 3.5 and 4. The Debt/Asset  ratio at the end of 2017 was 72 percent, slightly above the maximum typically accepted range between 60 percent  and 70 percent. All covenants at the end of 2017 stand at a critical level and in negative region.  28.  EDM is currently over-leveraged, with most of its financial debt denominated in foreign currency, this  situation would limit its ability to deliver on the future expansion plan of the company and capex execution  required to improve the quality of service.  FSP  29.  Cognizant of this situation, EDM with support from the World Bank started, in 2017, the preparation of a  Cost of Service Study that provided the analytical foundations for the development of a comprehensive FSP. Based  on the recommendations from this study, GoM, MIREME and EDM are taking specific measures as part of the FSP.  The FSP includes: (a) performance contract of EDM through the implementation of PERIP Component 2 to reduce  system losses from 29 percent in 2018 down to 19 percent in 2024; (b) a recapitalization process of EDM in line  with the recommendations of the Cost of Service Study (50 percent recapitalization); (c) CAPEX for electricity  access projects financed according to the NES; and (d) electricity tariff adjusted in line with domestic inflation and  full pass-through of generation costs.  30.  Financial analysis projections have been made assuming key provisions of the FSP are implemented. These  assumptions include: (a) implementation of PERIP\u2019s Component 2 to reduce system losses, from 29 percent in  2018 down to 19 percent in 2024; (b) a recapitalization process of EDM in line with the recommendations of the  Cost of Service Study (50 percent recapitalization); (c) CAPEX for electricity access projects financed according to  the NES; and (d) electricity tariff adjusted in line with domestic inflation and full pass-through of generation costs.  \n   The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 75 of 84         \n   Profitability  \n 31.  The tables below show the main figures from EDM\u2019s financial statement projections together with the  main profitability ratios for the company. Under the assumption of FSP implementation, EDM\u2019s profitability is  expected to return to positive numbers by 2020, with almost a breakeven in 2019.  32.  In particular, EDM\u2019s RoIC is expected to rapidly recover to 4.3 percent in 2021. Similarly, EDM\u2019s RoE should  rapidly deteriorate from a 6.2 percent expected peak in 2022.  Table 3.13.

The  quick ratio, although increasing from the poor level at 0.15x in 2018 to 0.65x in 2024, still remain under 1:1: this  shows that EDM would still have difficulties to meet its current financial obligations with the available quick funds  on hand. However, the improvement at current ratio level, from 0.66x in 2018 to a level above 1x, indicates a  better working capital management from EDM.  \n   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 76 of 84         \n   Table 3.15.

There is a growing market on standalone off-grid energy solution in Sub-Saharan Africa. The market was  born starting with solar lanterns, which typically provides a lighting and phone-charging function. Recently, there  is an increasing focus on SHS that is capable of providing greater level of service including multiple lights, phone  charging and radio capability. Although these solutions do not provide the same level of service as the grid  electricity connection, the technology can meet the basic service needs of off-grid population as well as the need  of backup power for grid-connected population.  2.  In Mozambique, the consumer confidence with regards to off-grid solar products is negatively affected  by significant variance in the product quality. The majority of solar product distributors are informal without  business registration and tax payment to the Government. Few solar products are certified by international  standards such as Lighting Africa, and therefore the quality of products in the market vary significantly. In addition,  as many of the product suppliers are not based in Mozambique, product warrantee or customer support is very  scarce. Consequently, the prevalence of inferior quality products has deteriorated the consumer perception of  standalone off-grid solutions and resulted in general skepticism in the reliability of solar products.  In addition,  these products in informal market is often priced significantly lower (up to 50 percent) than those in formal market  due to the different level of product standard but also due to lack of enforcement on value-added tax (VAT) and  import duties which could add 30-40 percent to the retail price of the products. Therefore, formal enterprises  with higher quality products face unequal playing field with informal players.  3.  Nonetheless, Mozambican off-grid energy market is starting to thrive. In the past two years, emerging new  players have started providing high-quality certified solar products with more flexible payment schemes such as PAYGO  model. The PAYGO providers in Mozambique are currently serving about 15,500 customers.   Figure 4.1. Products from SHS Companies (from left: Logos; Solarworks; Green Watts)  \n   4.  There is also a growing interest among solar companies to launch their business outside Maputo in less  developed regions. The solar companies are already operating in Gaza, Inhambane and Manica38 and a strong  interest has been observed to operate in Nampula and Zambezia owing to their population size and density. There                                               38 In Gaza, Inhambane and Manica, 35-45 percent of the population live below the poverty line according to World Bank estimate. In  Nampula and Zambezia, 60-65 percent of people are estimated to live under the poverty line.   \n The World Bank  \n Mozambique Energy For All (ProEnergia) Project (P165453)  \n   \n   \n Page 78 of 84         \n   is an interest to invest in LPG distribution chains. However, this expansion of both off-grid solar and clean cooking  solutions requires sizable investment as well as public support for demand activation and awareness raising.  5.  Affordability of standalone off-grid solutions is a concern for low income consumers. According to the  NES, average household monthly expenses for the 1st quintile of the population was estimated in MT 2,344  (US$38.6) in January 2018. Off-grid solution can replace households\u2019 existing energy expenditure, including  kerosene, batteries and candles as long as the price is affordable to the population.  Assuming that no more than  10 percent39 of the monthly expenses is devoted to lighting needs, an average household in the 1st quintile of the  will spend up to MT 234.4 (US$3.8) per month on energy. Assuming that standalone off-grid solution can replace  these expenses (except for grid-connected electricity which households will keep using), the cost of a pico-solar  solution would be paid back in 4.3 months, and the cost of basic SHS would be recovered in 2.1 years. Considering  the low saving rates of low income population, there are affordability concerns even for pico-solar products.   Figure 4.2. Payback Period of Typical Standalone Off-grid Solutions  \n Functions  Typical price of  direct purchase  Payback Period  Pico-Solar  \n MT 1,000  4.3 months  Basic SHS   \n MT 6,000  2.1 years   \n 6.  The use of SHS could be fostered by PAYGO models but hindered by limited usage of mobile money.  Typical price of a basic SHS is approximately MT 6,000 (US$99), which largely exceeds the monthly income of many  Mozambicans. Experience in East Africa suggests that the PAYGO model, which allows users to pay in installments  over 12 - 24 months, can effectively remove the customers\u2019 cash constraint for purchase. PAYGO typically requires  availability of mobile money that significantly reduces the transaction cost of monthly payment. While  Mozambique enjoys relatively high mobile network coverage of 82 percent,40 the use of mobile money is not as  common. It is estimated that mobile money is used by roughly 30 percent of mobile phone users, which tends to  be urban and economically well-off. The uptake of mobile money is constrained by access to commercial banking  facilities, which is required by mobile money vendors. So far, only two businesses41 in Mozambique offer PAYGO  as payment option to their off-grid customers; however, lack of clarity in leasing regulation is also observed as a  barrier to scaling of the PAYGO model.  7.  Significant working capital will be required for such rapid growth of off-grid market. This is particularly  the case for PAYGO providers that collect revenues from their customers over a period of 1 to 2 years. Since their  revenue stream is in local currency, they require affordable local currency loans to avoid currency fluctuation risks.  Current commercial interest rate in Mozambique is 25-30 percent, which is unaffordable for most local businesses.  Appetite for affordable loans has been demonstrated by credit line by BCI, supported by KfW. The demand for  such affordable local currency loan may grow further in the near future.                                               39 Normally 5 percent of monthly expenditure is used as the affordability threshold of energy expense. However, it has been observed that  many households in Mozambique consume more than 5 percent for energy expense. Hence 10 percent has been assumed.  40 USAID (2016) Mozambique Mobile Access and Usage Study.

Energy for cooking in Mozambique is currently dominated by traditional stoves and fuels as in most  other Sub-Saharan African countries. It is estimated that 80 percent of urban and peri-urban households use  charcoal in urban market and most rural households use firewood with traditional three-stone stoves. Charcoal  price increased significantly in the past year in urban/peri-urban areas, hurting the poor. Nonetheless, reputable  and aspirational clean stoves with proven efficiency gain (for example, Envirofit, Burn) in East Africa has limited  presence in Mozambique. The market faces similar barriers to the standalone off-grid solar solutions, including  custom duty and VAT barriers as well as affordability. Alternative energy for cooking, such as LPG, ethanol and  electricity are also emerging, but so far served primarily urban middle to high income users due to their  affordability and distribution constraint. However, there is a renewed interest in clean cooking solutions from  both public and private players. SHS distributors in Mozambique are exploring the inclusion of energy efficient  stoves as a part of their product portfolio beyond SHSs. As shown in Table 4.1, many DPs support clean cooking in  conjunction with off-grid solar solutions.  Mini-grid   9.  Mini-grids in Mozambique are publicly owned and operated through FUNAE.  FUNAE tendered out the  construction of mini-grids and maintained the ownership of these grids and bear the O&M responsibility. The bill  is also collected by FUNAE, in some cases at a rate different from EDM\u2019s. Using this business model, FUNAE has  been operating three mini-grids in Mozambique. However, owning and operating the mini-grids are costly and  stretching scarce human and financial resources of FUNAE.   10.  Therefore, FUNAE is exploring private sector participation into the mini-grid business models. There has  been strong interest from private sector and DPs for private sector led development of mini-grids in Mozambique.  GoM is currently developing a regulatory framework for mini-grid including the modality of private sector  participation. The mini-grid subcomponent of the project will pilot a public-private partnership in which FUNAE  will fund and construct distribution infrastructure of the mini-grids and private sector will be contracted to supply  power to them.  Development Partners  11.  Coordination among DPs and the GoM in off-grid space needs to be strengthened. Following the initial  success of PAYGO model in Mozambique, several DPs (for example, Sweden, United Kingdom, EnDev) have  launched or are preparing programs to support renewable energy enterprises that offer solar and/or clean cooking  energy solutions through grant provision and technical assistance. This support is likely to attract new market  entrants operating in East African countries (for example, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya) and thus scale off-grid market  further. However, the donor support is currently fragmented partly due to the shortage of GoM\u2019s strategic vision  and capacity in this space. Existing donor programs are summarized in Table 4.1.

US$4.5 million  EnDev\u2019s US$4.5 million program, coordinated by GiZ, entails both a solar and an Improved Cook  Stove (ICS) market development component aimed to support accelerated distribution of energy  technologies in the country. The current phase of EnDev program ends in 2019, and an upscaling  program beyond 2019 is currently being negotiated.

The MSGBC country is just discovering the true extent of its vast natural power reserves and that optimizing them may mean substantial increases to its current 38.8% national electricity access rate - taking the figure to 100% by 2030. Energy Capital & Power has partnered with Mauritania\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines to promote the nation\u2019s unparalleled works in the west African energy transition ahead of the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power Conference in Dakar this September wherein the region\u2019s narrative for COP27 and gameplan for green energy deployment will be collaboratively established. In light of this, here are five key green energy developments to watch in Mauritania over the coming year. AMAN \u2013 Green Hydrogen Set to be one of Africa\u2019s biggest green hydrogen projects, CWP Global\u2019s $40 billion, 30-gigawatt AMAN development will be located in the Dakhlet Nouadhibou and Inchiri areas of Mauritania\u2019s northern region. Its 18 gigawatts of wind and 12 gigawatts of solar will power electrolysis inland, generating 10 million tons of green ammonia per annum. The project was launched with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between CWP and the Mauritanian government and further ratified by a framework agreement made last month. It is expected to reduce national unemployment by one third by 2035, boosting the country\u2019s GDP by 50-60% within a similar frame of time. NOUR \u2013 Green Hydrogen In partnership with transnational energy company, Chariot, Project Nour targets 10 gigawatts with an investment of $3.5 billion. The megadevelopment was greenlit by the government with an MoU signed in September last year, further advanced last month with the return of positive results from pre-feasibility studies. Earlier in the year, Chariot also signed an MoU with the Dutch Port of Rotterdam for the latter\u2019s construction of a new globally leading green ammonia import terminal to launch in 2026, taking in 600,000 tons of green hydrogen per annum from Project Nour. Currently a consortium of backers are sought for the Chariot project to reach its final investment decision. TOUJOUNINE \u2013 Solar Averaging seven days of rain a year, Mauritania\u2019s climate is ideal for solar and the country\u2019s first major development in the sector did not disappoint in this regard with 54,000 panels supporting 50 megawatts production capacity at Toujounine, on the northern outskirts of the nation\u2019s capital. Completed in 2017, the $53 million plant is run by the national electricity company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mauritanienne d\u2019Electricit\u00e9 (Somelec), and has seen ongoing works since its inauguration by (then) President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, removing an estimated 57,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum and supplying 10% of Mauritania\u2019s net energy production. It also fulfils a local content function by hosting green energy training programs for local students and interns. KLIMA \u2013 Solar The Klima solar farm extends Toujounine\u2019s legacy with the German-built application by the same name, funding a solar farm stretching across 600,000m , through the pooling of contributions from 75,000 users seeking to offset their carbon emissions. This one-of-a-kind Mauritanian development supplies 15% of the country\u2019s total energy needs, covering 100,000 people, beckoning in a sound future for energy finance from an application just three years old. The Klima solar farm was first announced in July 2020, continuing to grow and garner support from that date as users take to the app from across 70 countries. BOULENOUAR \u2013 Wind Set to come online in the fourth quarter of this year, the Boulenouar Wind Farm will be Mauritania\u2019s largest at 102.4 megawatts, exploiting the country\u2019s 754 kilometres of prime Atlantic coastline. It is owned by Somelec and was originally slated for a 2019 launch but delayed, with construction beginning in 2020 for the 39-turbine facility, at a cost of $150 million. It is located in the village of Boulenouar 400 kilometres north-west of Nouakchott, the Mauritanian capital. Priorly, the country\u2019s largest wind farm was a 30 megawatts establishment in Noukchott. Looking Ahead From zero renewables in 2008 to the 38% electricity mix share it boasts today, Mauritania\u2019s green energy transition has come a long way, rapidly accelerating in line with the urgency of the climate crisis. But as the country\u2019s demand continues to grow at 10% year-on-year, the more advanced green energy solutions will be required from the nation to maintain and expand energy access.

Tanzania is in dire need to diversify its electricity mix similar to other countries in East Africa. Energy Permanent Secretary Eng Felchesmi Mramba said Tanzania has identified 52 areas that could produce geothermal power. These sites are spread across the regions of Mbeya, Arusha, Dodoma, Iringa, Coast, Kilimanjaro, Kagera, Katavi, Shinyanga, Morogoro, Mwara, Manyara, Rukwa, Singida, Songwe and Tanga. He made statement during his tour to inspect sources of geothermal energy at Kiejo-Mbaka and Ngozi in Mbeya region. \"Generally, the government intends to inject into the national grid a total of 1100MW produced from the renewable energy such as geothermal, solar and wind, before 2025,\" Eng Mramba stated. He added that the ministry makes huge efforts in developing sources of geothermal energy because such sources of energy are sustainable. \"The inspection we have done would help the government to take proper steps in developing such sources of power,\" he stated. He said during drought water level in dams would go down, thus affecting hydropower production, but the geothermal can sustain during droughts or rains,\" he argued. TGDC is covering several geothermal sites for potential development in Tanzania, including Ngozi in Mbeya and Songwe regions, Kiejo-Mbaka in Mbeya region, Natron in Arusha region and Luhoi in the coastal region. On his part, Acting General Manager of the Tanzania Geothermal Development Company (TGDC), a subsidiary of state-owned Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco), Eng Mathew Mwangomba, said the Kiejo-Mbaka site can produce 60MW of power from the geothermal. He explained that the government had disbursed about 20bn/- for development of the Kiejo- Mbaka site, and the company has already purchased drilling machine for that purpose. Experts from the TGDC in collaboration with development partners have done all required researches. He added that the Ngozi site is expected to produce 70 MW from the geothermal and that the TGDC is well organized to ensure that Tanzania benefit from power generated from geothermal.

This is an important step in closing the investment gap in renewable energy in the region, which will help reduce the adverse effects of climate change and diversify the energy mix,\u201d said Workneh Gebeyehu, IGAD\u2019s Executive Secretary. \n Financial support from the GCF The \u201cDesert to Power\u201d program aims to accelerate the deployment of solar energy in the Sahel, strengthening the transmission network, deploying off-grid solutions, improving the business climate, with the revitalization of national electricity companies. Through this program, which covers 11 African countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan), the AfDB aims to provide solar energy to 250 million people living in the Sahel. \n The pan-African bank also aims to make the Sahel the largest solar energy production area with an installed capacity of 10,000 MWp. In addition to the AfDB, the \u201cDesert to Power\u201d initiative is funded by the United Nations (UN) Green Climate Fund (GCF).

The minigrid will provide clean and reliable power to over 300 customers. With this minigrid, ENGIE Energy Access connects the people of Gbangba community in Niger State to an electric power supply for the first time ever and empowers over 300 customers, comprising households and micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The minigrid directly impacts more than 1,500 people by providing them with affordable, reliable and clean electricity. Vanguard reports that the minigrid was formally inaugurated by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State and Ambassador of France to Nigeria, Emmanuelle Blatmann, during an event attended by dignitaries from the Nigerian government, power sector, traditional institutions, youth, media and local community. Speaking at the launch Bankole Cardoso, Managing Director of ENGIE Energy Access Nigeria, said the country\u2019s electricity challenge remains a huge gap that needs to be filled in its journey to fulfill its full potential as a nation. Cardoso said the construction of the Gbangba mini-grid demonstrates how private investment can help to address the infrastructure gap in the energy industry. \u201cThis minigrid will foster socio-economic development and prosperity in the Gbangba community, its people and its neighbors. It will serve private households and commercial businesses \u2013 provision shops, grocery sellers, bakeries, mobile phone chargers etc. It will boost the productivity of farmers and food production by powering agricultural loads such as irrigation pumping and cold storage, productive loads such as grind mills and wood or metal working shops and semi-industrials such as telecom towers and processing plants,\u201d said Cardoso. Sub-Saharan Africa has the world\u2019s lowest energy access rate, with more than half of its people unconnected to electricity. In Nigeria, about 43.5% of people live without access to energy. This presents an opportunity to employ grand-scale innovation and the intervention of renewable energy solutions within the electricity sector in Nigeria.

The funding will allow the company to continue electrifying rural areas via solar home systems. Good news for Easy Solar. The company based in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown is getting a $5 million line of credit. The guarantee of funds in local currency (Leone) is provided by the Energy Inclusion Facility\u2019s Off-Grid Energy Access Fund (OGEF EIF). \n This loan fund provides primarily secured financing to support the growth of innovative off-grid energy companies. Managed by Lion\u2019s Head Global Partners (LHGP), the fund is part of the Energy Inclusion Facility (EIF), a debt financing mechanism for small-scale electricity access projects capitalized by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and other development finance institutions and commercial investors. Local currency financing According to Alix Graham, the fund manager for FEI-OGEF at Lion\u2019s Head, the local currency financing will allow the company to better manage foreign exchange risk and ultimately provide affordable products at scale to reach more off-grid households in Sierra Leone. The transaction was supported by the U.S. government\u2019s Power Africa initiative, which provided legal support and technical advice to Easy Solar through a team from the international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. With the OGEF EIF line of credit, Easy Solar wants to focus on expanding financing for its core solar product line. The company distributes solar home systems, solar lanterns, productive appliances, and consumer electronics such as televisions and fans and even freezers. \n Supporting Sierra Leone\u2019s electrification \u201cAccess to affordable local currency debt financing has been one of the main constraints to accelerating our expansion in our core markets and beyond. Partnering with FEI-OGEF will allow us to strengthen and simplify our balance sheet while bringing energy access to hundreds of thousands of people in Sierra Leone,\u201d said Alexandre Tourre, Easy Solar\u2019s co- founder and CEO. This line of credit supports the efforts already made by the company founded in 2016. In 2020, the company, which claims 300 employees, mobilized $5 million to electrify 450,000 people in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The funds were raised from Acumen, Nederlandse Financierings- Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden (FMO) and the investment platform Trine. These efforts are helping to increase the level of access to electricity in Sierra Leone. In this West African country, 77% of the population still lacks access to electricity according to the World Bank\u2019s 2019 report.

A SEforALL report issued at the end of March examined the role of subsidies for end-users. The goal being to further the reach of minigrid and off-grid initiatives. Looking at end-user subsidy programmes in Ghana, Uganda and Togo, the report assessed the development and implementation of end-user subsidies specifically for solar home systems. Solar home systems are a robust solution for the success of off-grid and minigrid initiatives. However, according to SEforALL, the affordability of these projects\u2019 electricity fees is, in many cases, unaffordable. This tariff plays a role in determining whether households gain and, just as importantly, maintain their access to electricity. This is where subsidies come into play. In the Ghanaian case study, the Ghana Energy Development Access Project launched the Improving Rural Energy Access through Solar Home Systems programme in 2010. SEforALL states that the programme is widely seen as a success. This positive pronouncement is likely the result of accurately calculating the subsidy thresholds for the country\u2019s different regions and targeting those populations that needed the subsidy the most, explains SEforALL. Another strong driver for the programme\u2019s success is the involvement of third parties. While a good strategy saw inclusion of the Association of Ghana Solar Industries and rural banks. With consumer affordability estimates on hand, companies can determine which markets to enter. They will also have information on hand to address the required concessionality to crowd in investment for an initiative from the private sector. While also planning which subsidy thresholds for technology would lead to increased uptake. The minigrid development battle continues Meanwhile, the African Solar Industry Association (AFSIA) Annual Solar Outlook 2022, published in January, expects minigrids will build a pool of electricity access in villages. However, the association draws attention to enabling C&I activity through productive use of energy initiatives. The downside is that minigrid stakeholders are still battling to reach economies of scale and undisputable commercial viability. The obstacles to these goals are high CAPEX and inadequate policy. However, the AFSIA report gives credit to solar home system providers who explore ingenuity as they develop better, cheaper and more diversified solutions. According to this report, minigrids are a unique form of solar capacity not found in the developed world but where Africa excels. Also, World Bank data suggests that Africa has the world\u2019s largest share of planned minigrids, with more than 4,000 in the works. Between that titbit of data, and these two reports for Q1 that examine the minigrid and off-grid market in some form or fashion\u2014it is, therefore, a tick for this prediction.

The project under New Sahara Ventures is one of the biggest projects in the district expected to light up Guruve and Mbire districts. New Sahara Ventures is enjoying a tax and rate holiday and the investor will also contribute five percent to community share ownership. The first phase of two megawatts was expected to be connected into the national grid on March 27 this year, but was stalled after a transformer in transit from South Africa was damaged in an accident. Guruve RDC chief executive Mr Tinos Marisa said the solar project is one of the biggest projects which will also benefit Mbire district in power supply. \n \"The project was started in 2018 in collaboration with the local authority. The target is to generate 10 megawatts and feed into the national grid,\" he said. \n \"The project is being done in phases with the first stage to generate two megawatts. The company was moving at a tremendous speed, but unfortunately last month they reported that the transformers were damaged in transit from South Africa. \"They are importing more transformers which are expected on the ground by the end of this month. So by the end of May they are ready to connect to the national grid.\" Mr Marisa said thus all areas fed by the sub-station including Mbire will experience no load shedding between 6.30am and 7.30pm. He added that the district is giving the investor maximum support because power is needed in the country. \"We gave the investor a grace period to pay rates and unit taxes to the council. They will pay once power is fed into the national grid and payments will be backdated to September last year. \"Inasmuch as we want revenue from the investor we will wait until the project kick-off. We don't want to constraint the investor until they start generating income from the project.\" He said the solar park developers are graduates from the University of Zimbabwe. \"They had experiences in developing solar energy from various countries and they have come back to give back to their community,\" he said. \"We urge other graduates abroad to come back and invest in the country because Zimbabwe can only be built by its owners.\" Guruve Solar Park founder Mrs Sithabile Chindondondo who is based in Guruve said they started the project with her two female friends. \"Apart from being resident in Guruve, this district was chosen for the project because it is receptive to developmental projects,\" she said.

The collapse of rail services during the six months to June 30 resulted in a 235 000 t loss of sales and also resulted in AMSA taking the \u201cextraordinary step\u201d of implementing a month-long shutdown of one of the blast furnaces at Vanderbijlpark \u201cto avoid the risk of an uncontrolled stop due to insufficient inventory, particularly of iron-ore\u201d.

RENEWABLES & GREEN DRI Meanwhile, Verster confirms that a decision has been made to push ahead with investments in solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind plants in Gauteng and the Western Cape, respectively, as part of measures to mitigate against intensifying load-shedding and to support its decarbonisation strategy. It is also possible that the solar PV investment being planned alongside its operations in Vanderbiljpark could be enlarged beyond 100 MW given President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s announcement that the 100 MW licence- exemption threshold for such projects had been removed. The wind project proposed for Saldanha Bay was likely to take longer to develop, as environmental authorisation was still required. Verster confirmed that AMSA, or the larger ArcelorMittal Group, would take direct equity in the projects, which were being prioritised as part of a decarbonisation roadmap, which would be released before the end of the year. The decarbonisation plan is likely to include a proposal for the development of 500 MW of renewables over time. In addition, a prefeasibility study was under way into the repurposing of the Midrex facility at the mothballed Saldanha Steel mill to produce green direct reduced iron (DRI), using green hydrogen as a feedstock. It is anticipated DRI will initially be sold in Europe, where it is likely to command a price premium, but could be used to produce domestic steel at a later stage.

ADVERTISEMENT \n \"Eskom\u2019s Just Energy Transition (JET) office places equal importance on the \u2018transition to lower carbon technologies,\u2019 and the ability to do so in a manner that is \u2018just.\u2019  \"Eskom is, therefore, committed to ensuring that the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of transitioning are realised, that employees and communities are involved in finding the solutions and that the transition does not exacerbate the already high unemployment rate in our country but results in a net increase in sustainable jobs,\" the utility notes in a July 28 media statement. ADVERTISEMENT \n The State-owned company says it is keen to assess all options for repurposing its sites to ensure greater community involvement, innovative revenue creation and upliftment of the socioeconomic standing of the areas surrounding those sites. The Netherlands too is committed to combatting climate change and the embassy says it supports the JET in South Africa. In keeping with this drive for alternative employment and economic development opportunities from both parties, in 2021, the embassy embarked on grant-funded agricultural-related studies at the Grootvlei power station. The embassy drew on the expertise of the territorial development team of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, given its expertise in the development of integrated territorial development approaches in the Netherlands and abroad. The aim of the study is to determine the most applicable climate-smart, labour-intensive farming and agricultural related repurposing opportunities for the Grootvlei power station site, to create a positive social, economic and environmental impact on the surrounding area, whilst ensuring local community involvement and empowerment. These repurposing opportunities will be employed in addition to the renewable energy repowering options that are currently being assessed for the site. These activities are complementary and fulfil the aim of Eskom\u2019s JET strategy to meet both decarbonisation and socioeconomic goals. The collaboration thus far has resulted in a Geographical Information Systems study of the Grootvlei area, a repurposing options assessment, a preliminary situational analysis of the property by horticulture experts, and soil and water quality analyses by specialists.

This Note further explains and illustrates the provisions of Clause 2.3 of the  RFP and shall be read together therewith in dealing with specific cases.  2.  Consultants should be deemed to be in a conflict of interest situation if it  can be reasonably concluded that their position in a business or their  personal interest could improperly influence their judgment in the exercise  of their duties. The process for selection of consultants should avoid both  actual and perceived conflict of interest.   3.   Conflict of interest may arise between the Authority and a consultant or  between consultants and present or future concessionaries/suppliers/  contractors. Some of the situations that would involve conflict of interest  are identified below:  (a)  Authority and consultants:  (i)   Potential consultant should not be privy to information from  the Authority which is not available to others;   (ii)   potential consultant should not have defined the project  when earlier working for the Authority;   (iii)  potential consultant should not have recently worked for the  Authority overseeing the project.  (b)  Consultants and concessionaires/suppliers/contractors:  (i)  No consultant should have an ownership interest or a  continuing business interest or an on-going relationship with  a potential concessionaire/supplier/contractor save and  except relationships restricted to project-specific and short- term assignments; or  (ii)  no consultant should be involved in owning or operating  entities resulting from the project; or  (iii)  no consultant should bid for works arising from the project.  The participation of companies that may be involved as investors or  consumers and officials of the Authority who have current or recent  connections to the companies involved, therefore, needs to be avoided.  4.   The normal way to identify conflicts of interest is through self-declaration  by consultants. Where a conflict exists, which has not been declared,  competing companies are likely to bring this to the notice of the Authority.  Schedule 3  \n   \n RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     89      \n   FINAL  All conflicts must be declared as and when the consultants become aware  of them.  5.   Another approach towards avoiding a conflict of interest is through the use  of \u201cChinese walls\u201d to avoid the flow of commercially sensitive information  from one part of the consultant\u2019s company to another. This could help  overcome the problem of availability of limited numbers of experts for the  project. However, in reality effective operation of \u201cChinese walls\u201d may be  a difficult proposition. As a general rule, larger companies will be more  capable of adopting Chinese walls approach than smaller companies.  Although, \u201cChinese walls\u201d have been relatively common for many years,  they are an increasingly discredited means of avoiding conflicts of interest  and should be considered with caution. As a rule, \u201cChinese walls\u201d should  be considered as unacceptable and may be accepted only in exceptional  cases upon full disclosure by a consultant coupled with provision of  safeguards to the satisfaction of the Authority.  6.   Another way to avoid conflicts of interest is through the appropriate  grouping of tasks. For example, conflicts may arise if consultants drawing  up the terms of reference or the proposed documentation are also eligible  for the consequent assignment or project.  7.   Another form of conflict of interest called \u201cscope\u2013creep\u201d arises when  consultants advocate either an unnecessary broadening of the terms of  reference or make recommendations which are not in the best interests of  the Authority but which will generate further work for the consultants.  Some forms of contractual arrangements are more likely to lead to scope- creep. For example, lump-sum contracts provide fewer incentives for this,  while time and material contracts provide built in incentives for consultants  to extend the length of their assignment.  8.   Every project contains potential conflicts of interest. Consultants should  not only avoid any conflict of interest, they should report any present/  potential conflict of interest to the Authority at the earliest. Officials of the  Authority involved in development of a project shall be responsible for  identifying and resolving any conflicts of interest. It should be ensured that  safeguards are in place to preserve fair and open competition and measures  should be taken to eliminate any conflict of interest arising at any stage in  the process.

[Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     117     PRE-FEASIBILITY REPORT  1  INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND   Power development is one of the key infrastructural elements for the economic  development of the country. National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. was set  up in November, 1975 with the objective of planning, promoting and organizing  integrated development of thermal power in the country. Central Electricity  Authority (CEA) is the nodal agency for centralize planning of generation and  transmission system.   In recent years, power development has assumed paramount importance in view  of its role in rapid development of industry, agriculture and service sector in the  country. The installed capacity of the country that was only 1713 MW in 1950  has already grown to around 1,47,458 MW by March, 2009.   As per meeting on 02.01.2002 between Hon\u2019 ble Minister of Power and Hon\u2019 ble  Minister of Railways, it  Was agreed that Railways would consider setting up of  power project (in joint venture with NTPC to meet its traction and nontraction  requirement of Power).   Accordingly, Nabinagar TPP (4X250 MW) was identified a joint venture project.  Cabinet Commttee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) accorded approval with equity  participation of NTPC as 74% and Railways as 26% respectively. The JV  company namely Bhartiya Rail Bijlee Company Limited was incorporated on  12.04.07. Nabinagar TPP (4X250 MW is presently under implementation stage.  Railways have shown keen interest for the installation of large capacity coal  based Thermal Power Plant (TPP) near Adra (West Bengal) for their captive use.  Director (EE), Railway board vide letter dated 10.07.09 requested NTPC for  preparation of Pre Feasibility Report (Pre FR) for setting up a 1000 MW TPP at  Adra, W.B.  Accordingly, a team from NTPC along with members from Railways  visited the site to examine the feasibility aspects.  Subsequently, in line with the discussions with Railway Board, the Pre FR has  been formulated considering two options for consideration and finalization of  plant configuration by Railway Board. The Option-I is for 2X500 MW (sub- critical  with higher reheat temperature) coal based TPP under and Option-II is for  2X660 MW super critical TPP.   1.1  PRESENT PROPOSAL:  The present proposal is for Pre-FR for coal based TPP at Adra. Two options has  been indicated in the Pre-FR i.e.   Option-I \u2013 1000 MW (2 units of 500 MW sub-critical units with higher reheat temperature of  568\u00ba C)  Option-II - 1320 MW (2 units of 660 MW, super critical units)  Railway Board may review the above options and decide upon the project capacity based on  availability of basic inputs (like land, water & fuel), power requirement of Railways for captive  use, project financials etc.           1.2.2  PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS   1.2.2.1       LOCATION AND APPROACH  The proposed Site is located near Adra (about 3 Kms from Adra railway  station on Howrah-Adra via Kharagpur Line) in Purlia district of West Bengal.  The main railway line is adjacent to the proposed Site. The nearest National  [Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     118     Highway is NH-2 which is about 45 kms from the proposed Site. The Site is  within the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) command area (Vicinity Plan of  the project site is enclosed at Exhibit-I)  1.2.2.2  AIRPORT  The nearest commercial airport is at Ranchi, located at a distance of  approximately 200 Kms from the project site. The Kolkata Airport is about 290  kms. from the project site.  1.2.2.3  LAND  Railways have about 1000 Acres of land in possession, which is proposed  for setting up of  the project. The land had been afforested by Forest  Department as per agreement in 1984. At present the proposed land comprises  of well matured trees. As the site is adjoining main railway line, after leaving  requisite distance from the line as per MOEF norms, the remaining land will be  about 700 Acres, wherein only plant & township facilities can be accommodated.  Hence, additional land for ash disposal is to be acquired within close proximity  from proposed site. The land is almost flat with local undulations seen at Site.  Sandy type of soil is visible at Site with probability of rock at a depth of about  5m as per information made available at Site.   \n The break up of the land requirement for Option-I & Option-II are as  follows:   Option-I (2X500 MW)  Plant area & Township :  650   Acres  (Approx.)  Green Belt  :     80   Acres  Ash Disposal Area                    :  500   Acres (Approx.)  \n Typical General Layout Plan  (GLP) is placed at Exhibit 2A    \n Option-II (2X660 MW)  Plant  \n :    710   Acres  (Approx.)  Green Belt  \n :     80   Acres  [Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     119     Ash Disposal Area                     :  600   Acres (Approx.)  \n Typical General layout Plan (GLP) is placed at Exhibit 2B     \n Railway to identify additional land for ash disposal as above.  \n 1.2.2.4  MAKE UP WATER  The water requirement of the project is about 40 cusecs for 1000 MW  capacity (option-I) and 55 cusecs for 1320 MW capacity (option-II). The nearest  river is Dwarakeswar River which is about 7 Kms from the Site. The river is non- perennial and is almost dry. The availability of water from the Panchet dam  reservoir about 40 kms from Site and Maithon dam reservoir about 55 Kms from  the Site on river Damodar & Barakar respectively were examined. Both the  reservoirs are under control of       \u201cDamodar Valley River Regulation  Committee\u201d(DVRRC). As discussed with officials of DVC, the water cannot be  made available from these reservoirs as the allocations from these have already  been exhausted. Hence, availability of water needs to be established by  Railways after discussion with DVRRC for making the project feasible.  1.2.2.5  FUEL REQUIREMENT AND AVAILABILITY  The annual coal requirement would be about 5.6 million tones per annum  considering GCV of 3400 kcal/kg for 1000 MW project (Option-I)  and 7.42 mtpa  for 1320 MW project (Option-II).  Coal is proposed to be transported upto project site through existing  railway network. However, railway siding has to be provided from the nearest  railway station for bringing coal & other material within the plant.  \n   1.2.2.6  MODE OF OPERATION  Base Load  1.2.2.7  POWER EVACUATION, START-UP & CONSTRUCTION POWER  \n Power evacuation arrangement of the project would be finalised in the  relevant Regional Standing committee meetings on power system planning/  open Access forums based on beneficiaries and type of project (Regional/  [Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     120     captive etc.). It is expected that Railways would be the major beneficiaries from  the project. Considering the plant capacity as 1000 MW the step up/ power  evacuation voltage is envisaged as 400 kV.

For both the options, the COE would be lower than the power tariff being  paid by Railways. The excess power, if any, after captive consumption by  Railways could be supplied to the grid since Demand- Supply gap exists in the  country. The project shall meet CDM additionality and is likely to generate CDM  [Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     126     revenue. However, 2x660 MW project is recommended in view of efficiency  considerations.   The following key aspects need to be addressed by Railways to make the  project feasible:   1)  Considering minimum distance to be maintained from railway line, the  balance land would be sufficient for establishing plant and township  facilities only. Hence, additional land for ash dyke (about 500 acres for  option-I and 600 acres for option-II) needs to be identified in the near by  vicinity.   2)  The availability of water is critical issue, since DVC officials during the site  visit indicated that water cannot be allocated from Panchet and Maithon  reservoirs. Railways need to take up with DVRRC for firm water  commitment.  3)  The long term coal linkage or allocation of captive coal block to be obtained  by railways.  4)  Forest has been developed in the identified land. Clearance for felling of  about 2-3lacs full grown trees is required to be obtained from the forest  department/MOEF.   5)  Since, the proposed Site falls within the command area of Damodar Valley  Corporations, NOC/clearance is required to be obtained from DVC.   6) The project cost and cost of Energy indicated in the Pre-FR are Indicative  and are not based on detailed design and BOQ.                              The enclosed Layout drawings and vicinity plan are indicative and typical  only.  Detailed layouts will be developed based on site specified studies  indicating Topographical survey, Geotechnical Investigations and other  studies at the detailed feasibility stage.  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   [Type text]  [Type text]  APPENDIX-III  RFP for Consultant for Thermal Power Plant at Adra     127     \n REGION WISE CONSUMPTION DETAILS OF RAILWAYS\u2019S LOAD CENTERS   \n   \n Appendix-3 Sheet -1 1.0 Region wise consumption details of Load Center Sheet -1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 BSL -

Kabaale International Airport, based at Hoima, started construction in 2018, with SBC Uganda as the contractor. SBC Uganda is a joint venture between Colas Limited and SBI International Holding of Uganda. The first phase was expected to be completed in April 2022. However, the pandemic pushed back the date of completion. It will now be ready for use by February 2023 as per the Government\u2019s new deadline. An SBC Uganda spokesperson, Amos Muriisa, confirmed the new date. On completion, the first phase will handle cargo planes. The construction work was reported to be 80% complete at the end of May 2022. The airport will play a major role in the quick movement of oil and gas equipment and will boost the development of an industrial park planned for the region. The first phase of the Kabaale airport will help import heavy equipment, material and machinery by oil and gas companies, who are currently initializing and developing their projects. Some of the equipment includes field flow pipelines, feeder pipelines, central processing facilities for the fields, as well as for Kabaale industrial park, the East African crude oil pipeline, and will later include the refinery. It will also help with equipment for related industries that will develop as a byproduct of the oil industry. The second phase of the Kabaale airport project will include an expanded passenger terminal which will provide a tourism boost and help increase the number of passengers passing through the airport. The runway, which is 3.5 kilometres long and 45 metres wide, is currently 95% complete. The cargo terminal building, limited-capacity passenger terminal building, air rescue firefighting house, power substation house, and the air-ground lighting system are between 78-90% complete.

In 2021, Tullow submitted a revised Turkana field development plan (FDP) and said the revised FDP is conditional and will depend on, but not be limited to, the introduction of a new partner. Its partners are TotalEnergies (25%) and Africa Oil Corp (25%). Tullow has a 50% stake in the project. \u201cThis plan has restructured a commercially difficult project into an investible opportunity. We are working with potential strategic partners to reduce our stake in the project to be more in line with a company of our size,\u201d said Rahul Dhir, CEO, Tullow Oil plc. \n The original plan aimed to produce 80,000 barrels per day from the oilfield but was delayed because of the collapse of oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic, which created roadblocks and commercial anxiety for TotalEnergies and Africa Oil. A new plan was created to focus on improving the project economy. The new scheme is expected to produce 585 million barrels of oil, which is at least 30% more than the original capacity. Also, the 825-kilometre oil export pipeline to Lamu Port on the Indian Ocean will be modified to handle 130,000 barrels per day and its diameter increased from 18 to 20 inches. If sanctioned this year, oil is expected to flow in 2025/26. Tullow is proceeding with a phased development approach to the project. It will commence with the Ngamia and Amosing fields, which make up 50% of the project\u2019s resources. The initial phase will also include the Ekales and Twiga fields. This will boost the initial phase tapped resources from 273 million to 390 million barrels. There is a projected increase in the number of development wells and the number of production wells compared to water injectors, which will help boost reservoir pressure support and increase recovery rates. Upstream facilities have also been increased to handle more oil and water volume. Africa Oil pegged the cost of upstream facilities at US$1.4 billion. The new scheme will lower unit costs from US$31 to US$22 per barrel. Carbon emissions will be reduced through a combination of heat conservation, use of gas for power and reinjection of excess gas. Kenya\u2019s national grid, which uses substantial renewable power will be used to offset any remaining emissions. The export pipeline will be heated and buried to ensure continuous oil flow. Water from Turkwel Dam will be used for injection purposes.

The company undertakes mining, civil engineering, building and road projects and operates in South Africa and other African countries. \n The Ikusasa building comprises three basement levels and four storeys above ground. It is part of the Oxford Parks mixed-use precinct in Johannesburg to be used by Anglo-American Global Shared Services (AGSS). Warren Mills, Concor\u2019s site agent, spoke about the management of about 70 specialized subcontractors by the company\u2019s core team, allowing it to meet the needs of the project. \n \u201cAmong the innovations used to cut the construction time was the use of larger foundation piles,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThis meant that there was no need for concrete bases or excavating around each pile; instead, the design allowed the columns to be cast over the piles.\u201d  Around 115 piles were cast with the columns spaced on an 8.4-metre by 8.4-metre grid which would hold the suspended concrete slabs. By speeding up this process, the wet trade contractors, that is, bricklayers, tilers and installers of the unitised fa\u00e7ade panels, could get early access to the site. This helped speed up external works and internal fit outs at the construction site. \n Another innovation used was to back-prop on two levels instead of the usual three. This enabled early access to the lower floor plate and allowed for early brickwork and \u201cfirst fix\u201d services such as floors, ceilings, electrical supply cables and water pipes.  \n The building's four levels comprise a 7,500-square metre gross living area with three basement levels making up 10,300 square metres. A total of 8,700 cubic metres of concrete and 800 tonnes of reinforced bar were used.  The company used sustainable practices at the building site, to reduce, reuse and recycle construction waste. This included separating waste at the source, and ensured that rubble, wood, steel and plastic were segregated. Preventing waste cross-contamination helped ensure efficient and cost-effective recycling of waste. The Ikusasa building will be the first of Concor's projects to achieve a 6-Star Green Star SA Office V1.1 design certification.  According to Concor contract manager Martin Muller, \u201cConcor\u2019s strict performance strategies to manage water use, energy consumption, process waste and pollution all contribute to upholding critical environmental standards.\u201d  \u201cIn addition to carefully applying our client\u2019s sustainable designs, our quality systems all contribute to the points requirement in the GBCSA rating,\u201d said Muller. On the Ikusasa building project, Concor applied a rigorous Waste Management Plan, which saw 70% of demolition and construction waste being re-used or recycled rather than going to landfill. According to Annelide Sherratt, head of department for green building certifications at Solid Green Consulting, four key members of Concor\u2019s site team completed the Green Star online course \u2013 which helped the team understand and apply sustainable ratings on the project. Sherratt explained that the Green Star certification focuses on nine categories of sustainability achievement, from management and materials to the reduction of energy use, water and emissions. \u201cAt the Ikusasa project, Concor reduced the portion of ordinary Portland cement used in their concrete mixes by 30% as an average across all concrete mixes used in the project, and achieved a level of 60% recycled content in the steel requirement,\u201d said Sherratt. Local sourcing of materials also played a role in achieving the 6-Star sustainability rating on the project, where Concor sourced 20% of the contract value from suppliers within a 400-kilometre radius of the site, and 10% within 50 kilometres. In terms of energy efficiency, the Ikusasa building aims to generate as much energy on site as the base building requires. This will be achieved through the use of a photovoltaic solar generation system on the roof of the building, producing renewable power. The building\u2019s design and operation will also enhance energy efficiency by applying sub-metering to track and control the main areas of energy consumption. Conserving water is another important element of the building\u2019s environmental performance. This is optimised using options like low-flow tap fittings and dual flush toilets, as well as water sub-metering for uses such as irrigation and bathrooms. Plant irrigation was reduced by 50% using water-wise irrigation methods and smart sensors. Also, the heating, ventilation and cooling system is cooled by air rather than by water.

The process of coal-to-liquids converts coal to fuels such as diesel or gas. For diesel, a plant converts coal to gas and then to liquid. The fuel produced is called synthetic fuel or synfuel.  The US$2.5 billion plant will help cut fuel imports and operate under a public-private partnership model. It will produce 12,000 barrels of diesel and gasoline per day, and have a planned lifespan of 30 years.  \u201cThe project has been approved for procurement, and production will primarily be for the local market,\u201d Botswana Oil\u2019s senior manager, Gamu Mpofu, said. Botswana imports at least 21,000 barrels of liquid fuel daily through South Africa, and faces shortages when that country can\u2019t keep up with this production volume. Botswana has abundant coal reserves of 212 billion tonnes. Its fuel imports amount to 7.5 million barrels per year. Although the current environmental awareness goes against the use of coal because of global warming concerns, Botswana is still actively seeking to industrialize its economy with its coal reserves.  \u201cThere is a case for using coal to produce fuel for Botswana and it will be done within the environmental considerations that the country has signed up to with various stakeholders,\u201d Mpofu said. Liquid fuels from coal are a source of clean liquid fuels. This is because clean coal liquefication processes capture and store the harmful emissions from the manufacturing process. Benefits Coal-to-liquid technology provides a long-term solution to the fuel security problem in Botswana. It will redirect a vital portion of state expenditure within the local economy for job creation. This will help broaden the tax revenue base for the country. It also forms part of Botswana\u2019s Vision 2030, which aims at innovation through transformation, and progress through investment in innovation, research and development.

This will help in selling food crops from the country. Tanzania has ambitious plans for the country's grain storage facilities and is already operating two grain storage spaces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. The large silos will facilitate the trading of surplus food between the two countries. This will improve bilateral trade which stands at US$905.5 million for the period between January to November 2021. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta agreed to compromise on trade barriers to improve the trading environment between the two countries.  This facility will be available for use by both the private and government sectors. The government ministries would only function as an initiator of export and will not be involved directly in selling the grain exports.  The grain centres in Juba, South Sudan and Lubumbashi in the DRC have already delivered 800 tonnes of grains to the two centres. This will help farmers and traders get more market access which will motivate farmers and increase productivity. The Mombasa facility is expected to outperform all the other current grain storage facilities. According to 2019 Statistics, Tanzania exported more than 97,000 tonnes of maize. This helped realize the need for launching a grain surplus scheme hence the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) was formed in 2010. SAGCOT helped create a healthy robust agricultural sector in Tanzania which ensured food security, environmental sustainability, and better livelihoods.

The new facility also combines solar photovoltaic, biogas and pyrolysis (thermal decomposition of materials at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere) technologies. These technologies allow solid waste to be converted into electricity. Funding from Germany The new plant, named \u201cHybrid PV-Biogas-Pyrolysis Plant\u201d has a capacity of 400 kW. For the government, the plant solves the dual problem of solid waste management and electricity supply. Currently, Ghanaians produce 14,000 tons of garbage per day, two-thirds of which ends up in sewers or is burned in landfills. The Gyankobaa plant was built by a consortium of German and Ghanaian research institutions in collaboration with Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation. This is the second phase of the \u201cHybrid Waste to Energy as a Solution for Ghana\u201d. The third phase of the project aims to create a business model based on the results of the technical and economic feasibility studies of the Gyankobaa Waste-to-Energy project. This model will serve as the basis for the construction of 10 other waste-to-energy plants in other regions of Ghana. Environmental and sustainability studies, as well as policy gap analysis and guidelines development, are also planned for the four-year \u201cHybrid Waste to Energy as a Solution for Ghana\u201d project. Germany financed the construction of the waste-to-energy plant in Gyankobaa with 6.2 million euros through the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. This will primarily benefit the population of Kumasi and its surroundings.

This is a loan to finance a project to electrify rural areas, mainly in the south of the country. Of the $180 million in financing granted to Rwanda, $140 million represents a loan from the African Development Bank\u2019s (AfDB) sovereign window. The other $40 million is from the Growing Together in Africa Fund, a $2 billion facility funded by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) and administered by the AfDB. The funding is for the implementation of the Transmission System Strengthening and Last Mile Connection Project (TSRLMC). This project aims to increase access to electricity in rural areas of Rwanda. It is part of the Rwanda Universal Electricity Access Program (RUEAP) which will be implemented until 2024. Electrification of 77,400 households Under the TSRLMC, the Rwandan government plans to build more than 1,000 km of medium voltage lines and 3,300 km of low voltage lines to facilitate access to electricity down to the last mile. It will also build 137 km of high voltage lines and six substations to reinforce the network. The project will also install or upgrade over 1,200 distribution transformers and related infrastructure. According to the Rwandan government\u2019s projections, the TSRLMC will provide access to electricity to 77,470 households. The project will also benefit 75 schools, eight health centers, and 65 administrative centers while providing 125 MW of clean electricity from hydroelectric plants. Additional AfDB funding The construction and management of the future infrastructure is expected to create 455 permanent jobs and 760 part-time jobs, 30% of which will be for women. \u201cThis project will improve the quality of life of the population by facilitating better access to education and health. It will also stimulate private sector growth, thus contributing to Rwanda\u2019s social and economic transformation program, which aims to transform it from a developing country to a middle- income country by 2035,\u201d said Aissa Tour\u00e9-Sarr, AfDB Group Country Director for Rwanda. According to the pan-African financial institution based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the recently allocated additional funding will support works in southern Rwanda, mainly in the localities of Gisagara, Huye, Nyamagabe, Nyanza, Nyaruguru and Ruhango. The project will also increase access to the grid in the towns of Nyarugege, Nyamata, and Kigali Hub \u201cas well as in other localities in the country where increasing commercial activity has increased the demand for electricity,\u201d the AfDB says. The TSRLMC has already secured $84.2 million in financing from the African Development Fund (ADF), the concessional lending window of the AfDB Group, in 2021. Rwanda currently has an electricity access rate of 49%, according to Power Africa.

The goal is to reduce its impact on the environment. The project was announced by Lusubilo Chakaniza, the managing director of Ethanol Company (EthCo). It involves the construction of a unit dedicated to the valorisation of ethanol waste into fertilizer for agriculture and electricity. The objective is to reduce the impact of its effluents on vegetation and aquatic biodiversity in Malawi. Indeed, the manufacture of ethanol produces a liquid called vinasse which contains potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc and sulphur. These are potentially harmful compounds. Plant delivery announced for December 2022 The Malawian company produces 12 liters of vinasse for each liter of ethanol produced. This is equivalent to 218 million liters of wastewater per year leaving EthCo\u2019s facilities. The subsidiary of the Press Corporation conglomerate specializes in the production of potable alcohol in Malawi. The process of upgrading this effluent will involve bio-digestion, evaporation, treatment and drying of the condensate to produce biogas. \u201cThe biogas will be used to generate steam to drive a turbine and produce about 2 MW of electricity, making the plant self-sufficient in electricity,\u201d explains Lusubilo Chakaniza, EthCo\u2019s director. The vinasse will also be used to produce a potassium-rich granular organic fertilizer that will be bagged in 50 kg bags \u201cto be sold at an affordable price. In addition, water recovered from the processing system will be treated and recycled in the plant. \u201cCurrently, the vinasse is stored in evaporation ponds for drying and the dried sludge is used by farmers around Dwangwa for crop nutrition and soil conditioning,\u201d says Lusubilo Chakaniza. The future facility will be operational by December 2022. The entire project will cost EthCo 5.2 billion Malawi kwacha, or about $6.4 million.
