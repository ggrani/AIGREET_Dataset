african development fund (adf) to finance the post cyclone idai and kenneth emergency recovery and resilience (pcirep) project and intends to apply part of the proceeds of this grant to make eligible payment for goods, works and services to be procured under this project. the total cost of the pcirep project is ua 16,340,000 (approx. usd 22.5 million), net of taxes and duties. the program will be implemented over a period of 4 years and will comprise three main components namely: (i) enhanced agriculture productivity and resilience (ii) sustainable socio-economic infrastructure and (iii) institutional strengthening covering project coordination, m & e, capacity building and disaster risk governance and preparedness. 2. objectives of the project: the development objective for post cyclone idai and kenneth emergency recovery and resilience (pcirep) project is to restore and improve sustainable livelihoods of the affected vulnerable groups of the population, enhance disaster risk reduction, early warning, preparedness, support inclusive social and economic recovery empowerment and enhance post recovery adaptive capacity. the program will specifically aim to reconstruct and rehabilitate damaged infrastructure (including roads, bridges, water supply and sanitation facilities) and to restore agricultural livelihoods. the reconstruction and rehabilitation will promote resilience to climate shocks and disasters, and enhance the adaptive capacities and preparedness of vulnerable communities. 3. the project includes the following three (3) components: a. component 1- enhanced agricultural productivity and resilience: this component will consist of restoring the productive agricultural infrastructure (boreholes, sheds, slaughterhouses, irrigation kits, etc.) and the capacity of the farmers to return and to improve their productivity level through provision of agricultural kits (seeds, fertilizer, planting tools, etc.); animal livestock redistribution (cattle, goats, chickens); provision and repairing of machinery; farmers will also be trained on climate smart agriculture and on the improvement of their adaptability capacity to climate changes. b. component 2- sustainable socio-economic infrastructure: this component will consist of rehabilitation of the cyclone-damaged roads, bridges, culverts and transmission and distribution networking. the damaged infrastructures constitute a serious constraint to reinstate economic activities and trade, isolating communities from markets and from access to services. major roads have limited accessibility and have been damaged mostly by erosion. this component will prioritize spot rehabilitation of secondary and tertiary roads to reconnect communities and revive local markets. c. component 3- institutional strengthening and program management: this component will focus on project management, capacity building in climate risk management, community development and training, monitoring and evaluation, financial management and development of a communication strategy. it will also cover project management activities including audit and m&e. 4. procurement of goods, works and services procurement of

agreement reference: 5550155001601 project identification no.: p-z1-c 00-020 1. the niger basin authority has received a grant from the global environment facility for covering the cost of the

delivery on the development of tools for adaptation to climate change and building pidacc nb stakeholders\u2019 adaptation and intervention capacity. 2. one of the major challenges of pidacc nb is the mainstreaming of climate change into countries\u2019 development strategies from regional and local perspectives. though some climate concerns are taken into consideration in a wide range of development activities, there is generally a lack of specific operational guidance on how to address them. this is largely due to the scarcity of appropriate approaches and tools, and the lack of sufficient and adequate capacity for assessing climate risks. 3. in light of these considerations, it is imperative to provide technical support to the programme\u2019 stakeholders at various levels in order to mainstream climate change adaptation responses in planning and implementing the programme\u2019s actions. this initiative will be implemented by developing tools, building the capacity and supporting stakeholders to effectively address and respond to adaptation needs posed by climate change challenges. the assignment aims at developing sensitization tools, both cross-cutting and thematic, relating to climate change basin wide (planning, implementation and monitoring & evaluation). the tool development falls in line with the context of the implementation of sub-components 1.3 and 2.3, namely \u201cstrengthening shared resource management\u201d and \u201cstrengthening communities\u2019 adaptive capacity\u201d. 4. services planned under this contract include: \u2022 establishing a diagnosis of climate risks facing stakeholders in the basin at various levels (local to national); \u2022 sensitizing stakeholders on climate risks at various levels (local to national); 2 \u2022 developing tools for raising awareness on climate change risks and effects at various levels (local to national); \u2022 developing thematic or sector-based climate change adaptation tools (e.g. for a crop crucial for food security in pidacc nb areas) at various levels (local to national); o developing good practice guides on climate change adaptation for communities; \u2022 developing cross-cutting climate change adaptation tools for communities at the local and country levels; \u2022 developing a climate change adaptation and intervention capacity building plan for pidacc nb stakeholders at various levels (local to national); \u2022 building the climate change adaptation and intervention capacity of pidacc nb stakeholders located at various levels (individual and collective) and; \u2022 providing support and follow-up for training pidacc nb stakeholders at various levels (local to national). 5. the programme for integrated development and adaptation to climate change (pidacc nb) coordinator is, hereby, inviting consultants to submit their applications for providing the services described above. interested consultants should provide information on their capacity and experience demonstrating that they are qualified to offer the services (documentation, reference of similar services, experience in similar assignments, availability of qualified personnel, cvs of key staff, etc.), supported by an expression of interest letter. consultants can team up to increase their chances for being qualified. 6. eligibility criteria,

introduction 1.1. reference is made to the general procurement notice (afdb-p494928-02 20 of february 26, 2020) published by both the african development bank group (afdb) and the african union (au) regarding a grant received by the african union commission (auc) from the african development fund (adf) to finance the institutional support project for the african union: african continental free trade area (afcfta) implementation. 1.2. the afcfta secretariat, in collaboration with the afdb, now invites interested consultants to express their interest in the following assignment \u2013 \u201cdigital trade expert\u201d. 2. background and rationale 2.1. the afcfta secretariat is the au organ that is legally established and mandated to handle the rules of trade between african countries in the context of the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area, which was signed at an extraordinary session of the assembly of the au in kigali, rwanda in march 2018. the overall objective of the afcfta is to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of business persons and investments, paving the way for accelerating the establishment of the continent\u2019s first ever customs union. with 55 countries, the afcfta will be the largest free trade area (fta) in the world in terms of membership, covering a market of 1.3 billion people with a combined gross domestic product (gdp) of us$3.4 trillion (2020). 2.2. the afcfta secretariat, established as a unique pan-african institution, has operational autonomy within the au system, and is the administrative organ that is coordinating implementation of the afcfta agreement. at the core of the afcfta secretariat\u2019s mandate is implementation of the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area, negotiated, signed and ratified by the state parties. the goal is to ensure that trade is conducted smoothly, predictably and as freely as possible across the continent. the afcfta secretariat, which is headquartered in accra, ghana, at the africa trade house, was established in february 2020, following the election of its first secretary-general. the secretariat operates a continental system of trade rules, acts as a platform for negotiating trade protocols, facilitates the settlement of disputes between state parties, and monitors implementation of the afcfta agreement. 2.3. the afcfta agreement is a framework agreement, with comprehensive coverage of trade in goods, trade in services, investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights as well as rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes. african continental free trade area secretariat africa trade house, ambassadorial enclave, liberia road, ridge, accra ghana email: secretary-general@au-afcfta.org | telephone: + 233 302 986 252 2.4. however, some areas (including digital trade) are currently being negotiated with a view to concluding the related protocols by december 31, 2021. the afcfta secretariat is providing active facilitation and coordination of the negotiations, in line with article 7 of the agreement establishing the afcfta, which provides that in pursuance of the objectives of the agreement, au member states shall enter into phase ii negotiations. furthermore, article 8 provides that all afcfta protocols their associated annexes and appendices shall form part of the single undertaking, subject to entry into force. 2.5. the current assignment concerns negotiations of the afcfta protocol on digital trade, which is in recognition of the critical role that digitalization plays in driving modern day trade and business transactions. the protocol on digital trade will be a significant tool for leveraging digital divide and boosting digital trade in africa. the protocol provides an opportunity for african states to develop a continental digital trade arrangement and could consolidate africa\u2019s position on digital trade rules in the global context. 2.6. as such, digital trade is currently being discussed as part of the afcfta phase ii negotiations, in line with the provisions of article 8 of the afcfta agreement. the protocol on digital trade would help to ensure that digitalization of continental trade adopts new approaches about competition, intellectual property, taxation, industrial policy, privacy, cyber security, the labor market, immigration and skills and trade, among others. 2.7. in view of the above, the afcfta secretariat\u2019s directorate of trade in services, investment, intellectual property rights and digital trade seeks the services of an individual consultant with relevant expertise on digital trade to support the negotiations of the protocol on digital trade under the afcfta. 2.8. funding for the current assignment has been provided by the afdb, through the institutional support project (isp) for the au on afcfta implementation. the isp seeks to support establishment of the afcfta secretariat as a solid entity, and rolling out related implementation programs to member states of the au. 3. scope of the assignment 3.1. under the guidance and

c.scotto@gebana.com & l.doerig@gebana.com terms of reference technical, economic and financial feasibility study state of the art mango and cashew processing plant burkina faso 1. background origin, nature of the assignment gebana burkina faso received a grant from the agriculture fast track (aft) fund african development bank (afdb) and wants to use this to fund a technical, economic and financial feasibility study for an investment project in a new state of the art mango and cashew processing plant in bobo-dioulasso, burkina faso. the objective of the investment is to construct a factory for mango drying as well as cashew processing. this will allow gebana to increase the volumes as well as the quality of its product. more smallholder farmers get access to the market and more workers (mainly women) can be employed in the factory. the new factory needs to be brc certified and comply with national and international food safety requirements as well as organic certification. waste from cashew shelling as well as mango peeling can be used to create energy in the production process. the new factory has hence an integrated energy management which reduces waste as well as costs and is beneficial for the environment. potential side products are another way to reduce waste and increase factory efficiency. the feasibility study needs to address questions on technology as well as energy use and factory construction. the aim is to have a study that allows the investors to take the detailed investment decision to launch the actual construction. the construction should be in a modular way so that the factory can grow over the years. the study should therefore give an overview for different options of size and mechanization in order to allow future development. also, the study should include a list of potential contacts for the construction of the factory. the project investment is estimated to approximately euro 3 million, however strongly depending on the degree of mechanization and the technology chosen. in a nutshell, the project comprises nine main subcomponents, namely: 1. dried mango factory \u2013 the group has seen enough potential in the european and american market to be able to absorb additional production capacity. now, gebana burkina faso exports around 500 tons of dried mangoes, 98% coming from external suppliers. experience has been made throughout the last few years in a small fully owned drying unit. the idea is to install a series of drying ovens for a total output of 500 tons of dried mango per season (april to july). however, in the first year, production capacity would start at 100 tons and then gradually increase. other drying businesses may be searched to improve the yearly utilization rate after the mango season. 2. dried mango quality control, storage and export facility \u2013 additional to the volume dried by gebana burkina faso, the company will continue working with the historical partners who deliver an additional 500 tons of already dried mangoes. therefore, the facility will have cold storage areas and sorting, flushing and packaging rooms fit for a mango campaign of a total of 1\u2019000 tons per year (april to july). packaging for the local market of other products is also envisaged to improve the yearly utilization rate. 3. raw cashew nuts (rcn) storage \u2013 currently, the company rents an external building to store the rcn. the new warehouse will be suitable to an increased production of kernels with a capacity of around 10\u2019000 tons. its building, once the site has been acquired, will be priority. 4. cashew processing factory \u2013 the company is now working in a factory that can produce a maximum of 300 tons of end product in 12 months. the new factory should allow for a capacity of 2\u2019000 tons of end product (kernels). through the modular construction, it could be envisaged to start with 1\u2019000 tons of end product and then scale up. 5. energy and waste management \u2013 the project aims to create the most possible energy itself in order to not be dependent on the public electricity network and in order to reduce emissions (off grid, zero emissions). the best possible final use of the remains from the mango drying (kernel, skin, pulpe etc.) as well as from the cashew shell (pyrolysis etc.) will be put in practice. other sources of energy such as solar or biomasses etc. need to be evaluated on its efficiency. 6. fresh mango export facility \u2013 currently the company has a demand for 60 to 100 tons of fresh mango for export (april \u2013 july). instead of loosing this business to others due to the lack of facility, it should be analyzed if an investment in a small export facility of fresh fruit can be profitable. 7. side product development & laboratory \u2013 if currently wasted material (e.g. mango pulpe etc.) could be used to produce a marketable side product (e.g. mango leather etc.), it should be evaluated if investments for this side product could be profitable. the company needs a small laboratory where it can run small tests for humidity or other quality parameters and where samples can be stored correctly. 8. offices and staff facility \u2013 when the factory will be running at full capacity, there will be approximately 2\u2019000 employees on site (exact number depending on the technology to be used). therefore, adapted staff facilities will be needed: changing rooms, washing rooms, parking space (also for logistic trucks), child care, health care, cantina, laundry for working cloth etc. office space will be needed for roughly 60 people (shared offices) including meeting rooms and training facilities. 9. sahelian dynamic agroforestry pilot field \u2013 as part of its commitment to the local community and the environment, the company will look at ways to study the amelioration of organic farm best practices applied to the sahel region. therefore, a pilot field will be adjacent to the factory. farmer trainings can be held there, but also tests for innovative production techniques can be run by our agro-technicians. the site could also be used for compost production if this could be a good way for using production waste. the test field will not be part of this study, however the size of it needs to be taken into consideration during the definition of the size of the land to be purchased. gebana burkina faso \u2013 private and confidential page 3 of 10 2. goals and objectives of the assignment the main object of this assignment is to elaborate the technical, economic and

sustainable energy fund for africa (sefa) grant for technical assistance support for scaling-up renewable energy programme (srep) (project id no.: g-gh-fzo-pre-001) request for expressions of interest for consulting services the government of the republic of ghana (hereinafter called \u201cborrower\u201d) has received grant financing from various donors (the \u201cdonors) under the sustainable energy fund for africa toward the cost of ghana sustainable energy fund for africa (sefa) grant for technical assistance for scaling-up renewable energy programme with the african development bank (the \u201cbank\u201d) acting as funds administrator. the gedap secretariat of the ministry of energy, the project implementation unit, intends to apply a portion of the proceeds of this grant to eligible payments under the contracts for the following studies: (i) transmission line study and design under gridco the proposed 161kv asiekpe \u2013 sogakope \u2013 tema (collector) transmission line is to reinforce the 161kv transmission network and improve reliability and stability of the ghana network for ensuring power evacuation from the eastern coastal areas to tema and for onward evacuation to northern load centers. the consultancy assignments envisaged under this sub-component are: a) assignment 1: feasibility study & design for the tema-sogakope-asiekpe transmission line to accelerate re integration under gridco (moe sefa ppf 1a gridco qcbs 01) the overall objective of this assignment is to prepare and submit to gridco a project definition report, a detailed feasibility study report, undertake engineering studies including the appropriate line route survey and prepare the bidding documents for the proposed 161kv asiekpe- sogakope-tema (collector) transmission line. b) assignment 2: esia for the tema-sogakope-asiekpe transmission line to accelerate re integration under gridco (moe sefa ppf 1a gridco qcbs 02) the overall objective is to prepare and submit to gridco an environmental and social impact statement, resettlement action plan including a property impact report as well as environmental and social management plan (esmp) for the proposed 161kv asiekpe-sogakope- tema (collector) transmission system. ii) re integration and market studies under nedco solar pv-based renewable energy technologies, comprising rooftop and ground-mounted applications of various capacities, ranging from a few watt hours to hundreds of kilowatt hours, have begun to spring up at various sections of the ghanaian electricity distribution infrastructure. this development, which is largely private-sector led, is evolving in the utility territories in ghana, with potentially negative 2 and positive implications for the technical and financial operations of the affected distribution companies (discos). the consultancy assignments envisaged under this sub-component are: a) assignment 3: re integration study for nedco grid (moe sefa ppf 1a nedco qcbs 01) whereas nedco is still working out the appropriate ways to react or respond to the negative impacts of the evolution of private-sector led rooftop solar pv installations, nedco management sees an opportunity to use strategic siting and sizing of rooftop and ground mounted solar pv installations to strengthen fragile nodal points on its distribution network. the specific objective of this study is the identification of feasible options, from the technical and economic perspective, for integrating re into the nedco distribution network at the utility scale and also rooftop pv. the study will be focused on variable renewable energy resources (vre), concretely solar pv and wind power. b) assignment 4: market study for nedco grid (moe sefa ppf 1a nedco qcbs 02) management of nedco recognises the realities of the threat of revenue loss to rooftop-solar pv- based degs due to increasing patronage by its \u201cmilk cow customers\u201d such as fuel stations, hotels, industries, irrigated farms, commercial establishments, hospitals, etc. as well as rich home owners. the anticipated effects of this on nedco\u2019s operations will include those on nedco\u2019s financial health and competitiveness in the future electricity distribution market, as well as the very survival of nedco as an electric utility in the rapidly evolving electricity supply industry (esi). the main objectives of the proposed rooftop and a limited application of ground-mounted solar pv-based deg integration in nedco\u2019s operations include: (a) attempt to cushion the financial health of nedco against the anticipated negative effects of private sector initiated solar pv-based customer-self generation, which threatens to erode significant proportions of nedco\u2019s revenue base, and avert a potential staff lay-off in future; (b) use solar pv based degs to strengthen selected sections of nedco\u2019s distribution infrastructure, including voltage management; and (c) use solar pv based degs to reduce the cost of serving a kwh of energy or cost of service per customer in remote and sparse settlements with very low energy demand. iii) grid assessment and impact studies under ecg as pv penetration increase, there is concern that quality standards of power supply to customers will be violated in regards to voltage, power factor and losses. the negative impact of large-scale deployment of solar pv include but not limited to the (i) potential voltage rises at load node, (ii) degradation of power factor at utility bus, (iii) injection of current harmonics by inverters into network and (iv) potential masking of fault from system protection. the consultancy assignments envisaged under this sub-component are: a) assignment 5: technical grid impact assessment under (ecg moe sefa ppf 1a ecg qcbs 01) the objective of this study is to undertake a technical grid impact assessment of deployment of 15,000 net metered solar pv systems on ghana's distribution network across the country, determine the percentage of cumulative solar capacity allowed at the distribution transformer level and 3 develop a hosting capacity policy for ongoing deployment of net metered solar pv within the distribution networks. b) assignment 6: commercial and revenue impact studies under ecg (moe sefa ppf 1a ecg qcbs 02) the objective of this study is to undertake a revenue commercial impact of deployment of 15,000 net metered solar pv systems on ghana's distribution network across the country, determine the penetration level of solar pv within the customer base of the distribution utility that will have significant impact on the revenue of the distribution utilities and propose utility strategies or interventions as well as tariff cost structure to mitigate minimize cushion the potential revenue effect of wide scale net metered pv systems or high growth of grid connected solar pv installations within the customer base of distribution utilities. iv) grid assessment and impact studies under purc the aggregate impact of significant variable re on the grid suggests the need for modifications to current procurement mechanisms and ancillary services market designs and rules and the potential for separate ancillary services markets. without proper compensation regime, ancillary services providers may be discouraged from providing ancillary services if they are rewarded for energy generation alone which would ultimately compromise the stability, reliability and resilience of the national interconnected transmission system (nits). the consultancy assignments envisaged under this sub- component are: a) assignment 7: development of tariff methodology for ancillary services for grid connected re projects under purc (moe sefa ppf 1a purc qcbs 01) the overall objective of the assignment is to determine a tariff methodology for ancillary services which would enable providers of these services to be adequately compensated and recommend for the consideration of the purc, a structure that will provide purc the capacity for preparing a tariff structure that will consider all ancillary services provided for the stability of the network. b) assignment 8: development of tariff methodology for mini-grids under purc (moe sefa ppf 1a purc qcbs 02) the overall objective of the assignment is to determine a tariff methodology for pricing electricity from mini grid sources, compare with international best practices and recommend for the consideration of the purc, a structure that will provide purc the capacity for preparing a tariff structure that will consider contributions from mini grids. v) assignment 9: full feasibility study, design and specifications and update of esia for 40mw bongo solar project under vra (moe sefa ppf 1b vra qcbs 01) the volta

policies, programs, and institutions. it will build a supply of adaptation projects by piloting, proving and scaling up successful initiatives fundamental to african nations\u2019 economic development, and prosperity for women and men. it will take promising ideas and early-stage programs to a regional and continental scale by developing and scaling up science-based solutions. it will also help to build demand for adaptation and resilience projects by demonstrating to donor countries how they can contribute to the costs of developing countries\u2019 adaptation needs. it will demonstrate how economically beneficial projects can be made financially attractive by paying project developers for adaptation benefits. it aims to achieve a balanced regional coverage to promote socio- economic development and poverty reduction in african countries through prioritized regional and continental initiatives implemented over the short, medium, and long term, setting the first targets for 2025. the aaap comprises the following four bold and transformative ideas: \u2022 climate smart digital technologies for agriculture and food security: will build climate- smart

strengthened through policy and regulatory reform programs. \u2022 innovative financial initiatives for africa: innovative instruments that tap the green investment markets; unlocking access to existing finance; and mobilizing new private sector investment by leveraging public sector finance to facilitate an increase of more than $5bn by 2025 of high-impact adaptation and resilience investments. innovative finance initiative (ifi) will be the enabling pillar to address these needs and support the financing for the other 3 pillars. the afdb proposes to establish and capitalize the african adaptation acceleration financing facility (aaaf) to mobilize usd 12.5 billion to implement the aaap. the african development bank therefore seeks to recruit a consulting firm to explore the

grant from the african development fund to finance the statistical capacity building program, phase v for the implementation of the strategy for the harmonization of statistics (shasa-2) across all adf-eligible regional member states (rmcs), sub regional organizations (sros), regional economic communities (recs) and statistical training centers (stcs) across africa. 2. the principal objectives of this program are to; \u2022 strengthen the statistics, policy, and decision-making chain: the proposed scb program is anchored on strengthening the data responsiveness of the african statistical system to the evolving development agenda through the implementation of shasa-2. the increasing demand for more and better statistics has brought to the fore the importance of data as a strategic resource for national, regional and international development. the effectiveness of national planning systems hinges largely on the availability of quality and accurate of data. data informs the setting of policy and development priorities and facilitates the tracking of performance, highlighting points of timely intervention and assistance. shasa-2 is cognizant of statistics as a global public good that transcends national boundaries. with its regional and global impacts, shasa is anchored on the design and management of the national strategy for the development of statistics (nsds) as one of its basic building blocks. \u2022 contribute towards the implementation of the shasa.2 as a continent-wide statistical framework designed to deliver timely, reliable and accurate data for growing current and emerging needs. africa\u2019s evolving development agenda is articulated in a range of recent strategic agendas including but not limited to national development plans (ndps), regional integrated strategic development plans (risdps), the african union\u2019s agenda 2063, the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs), and the afdb\u2019s high 5s agenda. the scb-5\u2019s implementation will improve the availability and quality of data that complies with international best practice. africa\u2019s ability to meet all the critical objectives determining its future resilience and sustainability hinges on its capacity to measure its progress using better statistics, for better policies, decisions and development outcomes. 3. the program has the following components: 3.1 component 1: improving the availability and quality of economic statistics, including the measurement of the covid-19 impact: the proposed program will focus on two broad areas namely the international comparison program(icp) and other economic statistics. the breakdown of the domains of statistics will be as follows: national accounts, price statistics, debt statistics, agriculture and food security, business registers, labor statistics, environment and climate change and purchasing power parity (ppp) statistics. 3.2 component 2 improving the quality and availability of social statistics and reporting on covid-19: the scb-5 aims at consolidating previous efforts across selected domains of social statistics by way of training and demand-driven technical assistance using international best practice. a second sub-component will involve strengthening the knowledge base on the state of infrastructure in africa. 3.3 component 3: data collection, management and dissemination the africa information highway (aih) has resulted in significant growth in the efficiency of data management and dissemination systems in rmcs. the scb v will continue strengthening the gains made in previous scb rounds on data management and dissemination systems. a data innovation lab (dib) will also be established to create an enabling environment within the bank and build the necessary skills and expertise to assist countries to reap the benefits of big data. 3.4 component 4: strategic planning, systems development, coordination and training: this component, focuses on raising the statistical capacity of national statistical systems (nsss) by responding to demand-driven technical assistance, covering the design, review, monitoring and evaluation of the national strategies for the development of statistics (nsdss) using best practice. there will be a review of outgoing and a formulation of incoming regional strategies for the development of statistics (rsdss) at the rec level, aligning them with the relevant country nsds as much as possible and as part of best practice. 3.5 component 5 project management this component covers project staff costs, supervision missions, preparation of progress reports, audits and financial statements, as well as the monitoring and evaluation (m&e) process, including the project completion report (pcr). 4. the acquisition of consulting services financed by the bank for the program, will be carried out in accordance with the bank\u2019s procurement policy for bank group funded operations dated october 2015

african development bank group (afdb) and the african union (au) regarding a grant received by the african union commission (auc) from the african development fund (adf) to finance the institutional support project for the african union: african continental free trade area (afcfta) implementation. 1.2. the afcfta secretariat, in collaboration with the afdb, now invites interested consultants to express their interest in the following assignment \u2013 \u201cintellectual property rights (ipr) expert\u201d. 2. background and rationale 2.1. the afcfta secretariat is the au organ that is legally established and mandated to handle the rules of trade between african countries in the context of the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area, which was signed at an extraordinary session of the assembly of the au in kigali, rwanda in march 2018. the overall objective of the afcfta is to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of business persons and investments, paving the way for accelerating the establishment of the continent\u2019s first ever customs union. with 55 countries, the afcfta will be the largest free trade area in the world in terms of membership, covering a market of 1.3 billion people with a combined gross domestic product (gdp) of us$3.4 trillion (2020). 2.2. at the core of the afcfta secretariat\u2019s mandate is implementation of the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area, negotiated, signed and ratified by the state parties. the goal is to ensure that trade is conducted smoothly, predictably and as freely as possible across the continent. the afcfta secretariat, which is headquartered in accra, ghana, was established in february 2020 following the election of its first secretary-general. 2.3. the afcfta agreement is a framework agreement, however, some areas are currently being negotiated. for example, ipr issues will be addressed in the afcfta agreement as part of the phase ii negotiations. article 7 of the agreement establishing the afcfta provides that in the pursuance of the objectives of the agreement, member states shall enter into phase ii negotiations on ipr. the negotiations of the protocols on investment, iprs, competition policy and digital trade are expected to be concluded by 31st december 2021. 2.4. afcfta entails more than movement of goods alone; innovation and branding are as much part of the value exchanged in cross-border or international trade. as afcfta african continental free trade area secretariat africa trade house, ambassadorial enclave, liberia road, ridge, accra ghana email: secretary-general@au-afcfta.org | telephone: + 233 302 986 252 seeks to enrich the knowledge content of products and services that are traded across borders, issues of ipr become important in spurring innovation and enterprise development. africa also needs to speak as one voice concerning international ipr regimes, and the afcfta protocol on ipr will be essential in creating the mechanisms for such a common position. issues of trademark registration, and technological advances and impacts on the new types of iprs that are emerging also make it imperative that the afcfta protocol on ipr follow a comprehensive review of the landscape. 2.5. furthermore, the role of the afcfta protocol on ipr in supporting the objectives of the two regional ipr bodies, i.e., the african regional intellectual property organisation (aripo), and organisation africaine de la propriete intelluelle, (oapi); development of a common approach on ipr for the continent; cooperation and technical assistance on compliance with the major global intellectual property agreements, e.g., the trade related intellectual property rights (trips), the world intellectual property organisation (wipo), etc., will strengthen implementation of the afcfta as a single african market. 2.6. it is against this background that the afcfta secretariat seeks to engage the services of an experienced ipr expert to support the work of the directorate of trade in services, investment, ipr and digital trade in the negotiations of the afcfta protocol on ipr. 2.7. funding for the current assignment has been provided by the afdb, through the institutional support project (isp) for the au on afcfta implementation. the isp seeks to support establishment of the afcfta secretariat as a solid entity, and rolling out related implementation programs to member states of the au. 3. scope of the assignment 3.1. the consultant is expected to carry out the following tasks: a. conduct a situational analysis of ipr in africa to facilitate the negotiations of the protocol on ipr; b. prepare technical notes and documentation to facilitate the negotiations on ipr; c. provide technical input and capacity building support for the meetings of the committee on ipr; d. prepare and provide required documentation for meetings of the committee on

project id no.: p-lr-k00-014 reference no. ipfmrp c 2.1.3 afdb issue date: june 30, 2020 end date: july 16, 2020 1. introduction liberia\u2019s main mineral products are gold, diamonds and iron ore. it is estimated that the country holds reserves ranging from between two to five billion metric tons of iron ore and three million ounces of gold (boakye et al. 2017). the major mineral commodities produced in liberia are iron ore, gold, and diamond. mining concessions cover an operational area of 113,256 ha (ministry of finance report 2017). besides the production of iron ore, gold, and diamond, liberia remains largely unexplored and has shown other minerals such as beryl, tin, columbite-tantalite, phosphates, zinc, copper, lead, rare earth minerals, nickel, molybdenum, beach sand (zircon, rutile, ilmenite, and monazite), bauxite, kyanite, chromite, uranium, and silica sands. all are characteristically associated with precambrian proterozoic rocks which underlie most of the country. however, despite these potentials, the efficacy of mineral valuation by the government of liberia has been elusive and has led to massive leakages in the country\u2019s ability to mobilize revenue from the mining sector, especially the alluvial or small scale sector. sensible valuation of mineral properties has become more critical in in recent years. valuation of mineral properties at the production stage is an area where both valuators and users of valuations like the lra need to understand the challenges and uncertainties involved. the government of liberia received financing from the african development bank (afdb), through the integrated public financial management reforms project (ipfmrp) ii, and intends to apply part of the proceeds to hire the services of an individual consultant to build the capacity of the natural resources tax unit of the liberia revenue authority in the area of mineral valuation 2. objective of the assignment the general objective of this assignment is to hire an individual consultant to build the capacity of the natural resource tax section to administer natural resource taxes. the specific objective are as follows: i. to train and build the skills of staff of the natural resource tax section in basic concepts and methods of mineral valuation. this training should introduce concepts and methods that will allow participants to understand mining economics and valuation techniques; ii. to equip participants with advanced skills regarding the valuation and reporting of a range of mineral assets; iii. to provide an overview of the liberian mining industry, particularly the artisanal small- scale mining sector; iv. to introduce participants to the different types of mineral assets and their characteristics; v. to equip staff with skills to understand and apply the legislative framework relevant for mineral asset valuation and reporting in liberia, where applicable; vi. to assist the staff to determine the market value of various types of mineral assets using appropriate valuation approaches, methods and techniques; vii. to interpret and apply international valuation standards and international financial reporting standards to mineral asset valuation and reporting; and, viii. to improve knowledge and develop skills in the development of a fiscal regime for the taxation of the informal mining sector. 3. scope of the services to be performed the assignment entails performing the following tasks: i. work with the natural resource tax section (nrts) to strengthen its capacity in understanding the informal sector; ii. build the capacity of the nrts in basic contemporary concepts and methods of mineral valuation using statistical methods or any other applicable means; iii. develop course outline and contents that would lead to successful delivery of the knowledge improvement and skills development within the natural resource tax section in the area of mineral valuation and other related topics; iv. supervise a practical session on mineral valuation on some aspects of the training course to be determined by the consultant in collaboration with the lra; v. prepare powerpoint presentations, training manual and necessary handouts covering for the training program on the basis of the courses topics outlined in annex i of the tor; vi. prepare and submit the training updates with photographs of the participants and the training activities attended; vii. submit the final training documents (training manual and training materials such as, but, not limited to, power point

african development bank group (afdb) and the african union (au) regarding a grant received by the african union commission (auc) from the african development fund (adf) to finance the institutional support project for the african union: african continental free trade area (afcfta) implementation. 1.2. the afcfta secretariat, in collaboration with the afdb, now invites interested consultants to express their interest in the following assignment \u2013 \u201ctechnical assistance and capacity building support for sao tome and principe on submission of tariff offers covering 90 percent of trade in goods and in hs 2017 format\u201d. 2. background and rationale 2.1. the afcfta secretariat is the au organ, legally established and mandated to handle the rules of trade between african countries. the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area was signed at an extraordinary session of the assembly of the au in kigali, rwanda, on 21 march 2018. the overall objective of the afcfta is to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of business persons and investments, paving the way for accelerating the establishment of the continent\u2019s first ever customs union. with 55 countries, the afcfta will be the largest free trade area (fta) in the world in terms of membership, covering a market of 1.3 billion people with a combined gross domestic product (gdp) of us$3.4 trillion (2020). 2.2. the afcfta agreement is a framework agreement, with comprehensive coverage of trade in goods, trade in services, investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, women and youth in trade, and digital trade as well as rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes. 2.3. the afcfta secretariat, established as a unique pan-african institution, has operational autonomy within the au system, and is the administrative organ that is coordinating implementation of the afcfta agreement. at the core of the afcfta secretariat\u2019s mandate is implementation of the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area, negotiated, signed and ratified by the state parties. the goal is to ensure that trade is conducted smoothly, predictably and as freely as possible across the continent. the afcfta secretariat, which is headquartered in accra, ghana, at the africa trade house, was established in february 2020, following the election of its first secretary-general. the secretariat operates a continental system of trade rules, acts as a platform for negotiating trade protocols, african continental free trade area secretariat africa trade house, ambassadorial enclave, liberia road, ridge, accra ghana email: secretary-general@au-afcfta.org | telephone: + 233 302 986 252 facilitates the settlement of disputes between state parties, and monitors implementation of the afcfta agreement. 2.4. the current request for expressions of interest is to enable the secretariat deliver technical assistance to state parties of the agreement on preparation of key documents that will enable them to participate fully in implementation of the afcfta agreement. the current support is in line with the 29th ordinary summit of heads of state and government, which took place on july 3rd \u2013 4th, 2017 that approved an ambitious target of 90 percent of tariff liberalization on goods imported from au member states. in this regard, member states are expected to undertake tariff liberalization of 90 percent within five (5) years for developing countries, and 10 years for least developed countries (ldcs). sensitive products covering 7 percent of national tariff lines will be liberalized from the 6th year after the commencement of tariff dismantling on non-sensitive items. the excluded products must not exceed more than 3 percent of tariff lines with an intra-african import value limit of not more than 10 percent. 2.5. the 13th extra ordinary session of heads of state and government, which was held virtually on 5th december 2020, also directed au member states and state parties to finalize the outstanding rules of origin (roo) and submit their final schedules of tariff concessions by june 2021. furthermore, the fifth meeting of the council of ministers responsible for trade inter alia urged non-state parties to ratify the afcfta agreement in order to facilitate implementation of the afcfta while commending and inviting state parties non state parties and customs unions that have submitted tariff offers covering 90% to officially submit them to the afcfta secretariat for provisional implementation once approved by the council of ministers, pending adoption by the assembly in order to take legal steps identified by the legal counsel to deposit the schedule of tariff concessions. 2.6. the next summit of heads of state and government is expected to decide on the operationalization of tariff preferences contained in the offers, which designate 90% of tariff lines as category a and also include the base rates for non-categorized tariff lines. the base rate is the mfn rate applicable on entry into force of the agreement establishing the afcfta, i.e., 30 may 2019. the modalities for tariff liberalization require undertaking of tariff commitments as specifically spelt out in the protocol. furthermore, these schedules of commitments in compliance with the said modalities, when formally submitted, become the legally binding obligations of the state parties to the afcfta agreement. 2.7. the afcfta secretariat intends to provide technical assistance to selected state parties that have expressed a need for preparation and submission of schedules of tariff concessions in compliance with the decision of the extra-ordinary summit. african continental free trade area secretariat africa trade house, ambassadorial enclave, liberia road, ridge, accra ghana email: secretary-general@au-afcfta.org | telephone: + 233 302 986

funding for electricity access in guinea. the project for which the guinean transitional government is obtaining funding aims to strengthen access to electricity in six towns and surrounding areas. of the us$66.39 million in funding to guinea, us$13.54 million is being provided by the african development fund (adf), the concessional lending arm of the african development bank (afdb) group. the bulk of the funding, $52.85 million, is being provided by the african transition facility, an autonomous entity within the afdb group dedicated to supporting fragile and conflict-affected states. guinea is currently undergoing a transition phase following the military putsch that overthrew former president alpha conde on 5 september 2021. the transitional body, the national rallying committee for development (cnrd), headed by colonel mamadi doumbouya, is continuing to implement the guinea electricity access improvement project (paaeg) for which the afdb board of directors has just approved financing. infrastructure development the paaeg involves the construction of 797 km of medium voltage lines to connect at least 40 localities. the work will also consist of the construction of 47 km of mixed lines, 984 km of low-voltage lines, 21 high and low-voltage substations and 128 h61 substations (transformers with a power rating of between 50 and 160 kva). as a result of this work, the public company \u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de guin\u00e9e (edg) will distribute 37,367 household connection facilities to the national electricity network. these installations will be carried out in the cities of kankan, k\u00e9rouan\u00e9 and siguiri in the upper guinea region and nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, beyla and lola in forest guinea. in addition to the deployment of electrical infrastructure, \u201cthe project will support reform initiatives in the electricity sub-sector and capacity building of its actors. it will also promote the productive use of electricity by providing women\u2019s groups with equipment to increase their productivity. also, public lighting will enhance security and allow women to have more time to carry out their commercial activities and school children to improve their school results,\u201d explains l\u00e9andre bassol\u00e9, the afdb group\u2019s country manager for guinea. co-financing from several development partners according to him, \u201cimproving access to electricity will help create optimal conditions for better diversification of the guinean economy with local processing of bauxite on the one hand, and agricultural products on the other,\u201d the afdb official said. the guinea electricity access improvement project is co-financed by the united states agency for international development (usaid) under its energy for africa programme. the guinean government is also receiving support from the islamic development bank (idb) and the sustainable energy fund for africa (sefa), a financing mechanism managed by the afdb. for the record, the paaeg is being implemented within the framework of the development of hydroelectric production in guinea, which has led to the launch of the souapiti hydroelectric project on the
